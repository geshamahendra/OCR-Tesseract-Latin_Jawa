There was an excellent and famous king, renowned throughout the world
and respected by his enemies, victorious, and adept in all kinds of know-
ledge, whose name was the unequalled Dasaratha.

He was the father of Triwikrama, that is god Wigṇu when he descended to
earth for the purpose of bringing happiness to the world.

Sang Dataratha was full of moral excellence, he knew the wkdas, he was

devoted to the gods, never forgot to worship his ancestors, and loved all the
members of his family.

the body, but they were not found in him, as he was gallant and wise in all
his conducts.

needy and humble people, moreover to the ascetics and religious teachers.
