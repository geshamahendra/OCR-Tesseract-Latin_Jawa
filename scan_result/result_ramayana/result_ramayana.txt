It happened that it was autumn when they started their journey. The

with excellent bathing-places, and gardens; the water of the lakes and
waterfalls was clear.

There were red and white lotusses [with] bumble-bees buzzing energeti-
cally. Also a soft fragrant breeze was blowing, arousing delight in the
hearts of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa.

Gracefully the trees seemed to look down, gazing at their clear reflection

When the sun came up, the red lotuses wilted, uietly their beauty dis-
appeared. All the trees seemed to join in their grief, the noisy cries of the
birds were as in mourning.

Besides, the trees and the lake seemed to look at each other with ecstacy.
The white flowers [of the trees and the white lotuses] were as their eyes,
the black bumble-bees upon the.n were the irises [of the eyes].

The blue lotusses were moving, blown by the wind. They seemed to reject
their husbands because of great jealousy. They were angry, because the
bumble-bees had visited the red lotusses frst. Being jealous is characteris-
tic of a devoted wife.

There, in the forest a bee, drunk [with honey], was buzzing softly, a deer

in her heart, as the sleep slipped away, because she repeatedly heard the
pining of the geese.

Thus was the beauty they saw in the forest and villages. They saw the
rice-ñeld with excellent rice-plants growing rapidly and successfully. They
looked brilliantly green after being weeded, and Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa
looked upon them with delight.

The beautiful cow-girls who were in charge with the stables, were girls
from the mountains and were pure and simple in their behaviour. When
they saw the two brothers passed by, the one aker the other, they were
infatuated, and when [the princes] looked at the cows, [the girls] gave them
side-glances.

The deep soft sound of the stirring of the milk was like the music of people

Because it was autumn, the deer were high-spirited and frolicked fast there,

them.

There was a pure white massive and enormous cloud spreading along the

A lion, staying in a cave on the slope of the mountain, roared, and the echo
came back loudly in thesky. Angrily he looked up and wanted to pounce.
¢Ah, dumb lion? He thought his enemy was roaring [in reply].

On the other slope a beautiful lake could be seen. There were only white
lotuses, none were red ones. No white swans were seen, only their pining
was heard, soft and vague.

All the lakes had lotuses, upon all the lotuses were bumble-bees, all the
bumble-bees were humming. and it was all pleasant to the ears, not one was
distressing.

After they had eaten to their fll the food offered by the ascetics, they
walked around the hermitage. All the ascetics were impressed [with their
appearance] and addressed them kindly, [expressing the hope] that their
stay may be comfortable and that the hermitage may become peaceful.

The sage liked them very much and gave them excellent weapons. Rāma
and Lakṣmaṇa were instructed to learn formulae which made them inwvul-
ṇerable, victorious and undefeatable [so that] they [would always] win.
These were his gifts to them, excellent and extremely powerful [formulae].

After all the formulae were clearly absorbed by them, they travelled around
to the beautiful spots of the forest. They saw an ogress, a subject of king
Daśāsya, called Tāṭakā, coming only with the intention to kill them.

Rāma was prepared. He drew his excellent bow, with a sharp arrow on
it. He aimed at her neck and as scon as he discharged the arrow, Tāṭakm

Afer she was killed, the great sage was very happy, there was no longer any
danger, the hermitage became prosperous. The birds stopped making noise
as they were afraid of being attacked by young monks who were talking
[freely] now.

Before, when Tātakī was alive, the hermits were silent, the tigers were
uiet, staying in their caves with their bodies sweating [because of fear].
The lions were lean and moaning, they howled from hunger, only the rhino-
ceroses were satisñed feeding themselves on thorny plants.

Afer the death of the fearful Tāṛakā, the tigers broke their fasting with
many deer, the lions savagely went into the forest to hunt for a huge ele-
phant to break their fasting.

When the hermitage was secure and developed into perfection, the great
sage paid tribute to Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa. They were bathed, their feet
washed and they were seated on a hench, and upon perceiving their excel-
lent origin, he said:

Hé Rāma Lakṣmaṇa anaku nihan rĕṅbnta,

*Hey Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, my sons\ Listen, you are the manifestation of
Nārāyaṇa, the embodime.:t of Wiṣṇu. All the world was supported by you
in the past. We want to make a sacrifice, please protect us.

Thus spoke the great sage, the honoured ones replied: ¢At your service, o,
great sage. Do not worry, because the power of your asceticism is enor-
mous and cannot be surpassed. That would make us victorious over your
enemies.

When all the sages were given the opportunity to make their sacrifce,
not long afterwards the enemy came in throngs and were very horrible.
There in the sky, they looked like hovering clouds, their Aaming teeth the

Lakṣmaṇa looked up quickly, lined up his feet ñrmly and drew his bow.
Without error he aimed his crescent-shaped arrow [at the demons] and they
were all killed, smashed into pieces.

Their heads looked terrible like that of the horrible Rāhu, their cries sounded
fearfully in the sky and their bodies fell down thunderously. All the hermits
were frightened at the sight of them.

advancing to attack. Rāma was not affected, courageously and firm ot
mind, he stepped forward. The Prince spoke in order to interrogate

It was formerly the great bow of Parameśwara with which Tripura was

When he arrived at the excellent city of Mithilā, king Janaka went to meet
him respectfully, with offerings of all kinds of food and drink to welcome
him. Looking happy, king Janaka spoke:

‘Well, o, heroic king with great powers, dkarmu (religious acts), arthu (gather-

ing worldly wealth), kāma (striving for sexual fulñlment of progeniture),
should be observed also by a kṣatriva (warrior caste). You are a close
friend of god Indra, almost a deity yourself. How fortunate I am, that
Your Majesty has come herec.

Afer paying due homage, they both entered the wedding pavillion with
happiness in their hearts. They sat side by side, a little embarrassed but
full of joy. It is not proper to relate about their sleeping together there.

Night passed. It was morning. The sun came up. King Daśaratha
reuested leave to return to Ayodhyā together with his sons Rāma and
Iakṣmaṇa. S1ītā went too together with all her entourage.

Also highranking offcials and ministers went along, all on horseback. They
went through beautiful places in the forest. Suddenly there was a brahmin
with awe-inspiring appearance, blocking their way. He wasas tall us a
palm-tree and carried a bow on his shoulder.

‘Hey Rāmadéwa. 1I also am called Rāma by the world. If you are power-

Thus Paraśurāma (Rāma with the axe) spoke, ready for a duel. Sītī was
filled with fear, her body trembled, seeing [a person] she had never seen
before. While constantly paying homage with folded haṇds out of love for
his son and daughter in law, king Daśaratha spoke.

He gave his extremely large and long bow together with an arrow to
prince Rāma.  If you can draw it, you win. I will pay my tribute to you’,
he said, eager to try the strength [of prince Rāma].

Rāmadéwa, brave and frm of mind, stepped forward and received the big

the arrow on it. Jāmadagni was surprised, his face turned pale, and he
remained silent.

éAlas, alas ! the king is very harsh and inconsiderate of virtuous [people].

did not wish to be left behind.

His bed was cool, soft and smooth, his body was anointed with cream made
of grounded roots and sandalwood, but these had no effect at all, it could
not bring his temperature down, he felt his body was hot all over. Because
of deep remorse he returned to heaven.

All the high-ranking ofñcials and ministers assembled and entered the
palace. Bharata, who was sent for, immediately departed [from his grand-
father's place] and arrived soon after. He saw that the city was deserted,
everything seemed to have come to a standstill. There seemed to be a
breakdown on the highway, as nobody turned up to do busincss.

With doubtful mind he entered the audience hall, everyone he met, was in
tears. He asked about the disease which lead to the death of the king.
Then respectfully his mother told him [everything].

When he heard about the reason for the death of the king, he was greatly
infuriated with his mother. Then he spoke: ‘How cruel you are, mother.
And extremely wicked. You had the heart to foil the plans of the king
and allowed him no rest.

Thus were his words of abuse towards Kékayī, he did not want to be
crowned king. He was firm and devoted to his older brother. Incessantly
his tears flowed down, out of grief. Then he was reminded to think about
the dead body of the king.

He was addressed by all his subjects as well as by his mother. His sorrow
disappeared, his mind became clear and pure again, because that is life.
Everything born should end up in death. That was in his mind so that
his sorrow vanished.

He ordered the chief of the army to cremate the body of the king. He
performed the rituals of puriñcation and ceremonies for the death at the end
of the month. When it was over, Bharata wanted to look for Rāghawa,
because of his true devotion to his older brother, which should serve as an
example to the world.

Elephants, horses, and wagons were the vanguard of the accompanying
troups which were prepared to follow prince Bharata, who immediately
departed. He arrived at [the limits] of the forests and with wagons, horses,
elephants etc. he entered the woods to search for Rāghawa.

At the banks of the river Tamasā, it was very diffcult to get by. The woods
were thick and impassible with large deep caves. Besides, the ravines and
river banks were steep and full of perils, but prince Bharata was not afraid
to lead the search for his brother.

As he did not find him, he just pressed on unwearily, and arrived at a
fawless and sacred river, the wellknown river, Gaṅgā. pure and white
like the crystals of candrakānta stones. Likewise was the mind of Bharata,
truly devoted to his older brother.

Then he went further in, and came to another big river, the well known

When he went further, he came to a hermitage. It was the prosperous and
attractive hermitage of the sage Bharadwāja. Daylight was suddenly gone,
nightfall arrived. The great sage together with his pupils respectfully
welcomed him.

At daybreak they guickly set out again to look for the older brother. He
[Bharata] together with his troops arrived at the excellent lake of Mandākinī.
By accident they met a naked forest-dweller who told him the place where
Rāghawa lived.

Pawitra hana Citrakuṭagiri durggamāwān magöṅ,

¢There on the holy mountain of Citrakūṭa, big and high and inaccessible
[to men], but attractive with beautiful scenery. is the place where Rāghawa
Jivesṛ Bharata, rejoicing at receiving the information, promptly left for
the inaccessible mountain, followed by his troops.

When they came near the place, Lakṣmaṇa saw them. Suspecting them to
be an approaching enemy, he put up his bow, wore his armour and stood
ready and frm, with his eyebrows twitching with anger and furrows appear-
ing on his forehead.

Then he saw that they were not armed, there were no lances and shields,
though there were many horses, elephants and rows of wagons. As they came
closer, he knew [who came] and laid down his bow. He went to his brother
Rāghawa to inform him.

which was burnt to ashes and scattered [by the wind].

When the perfect great sage had reached heavenly Bliss leaving the son of
Raghu, Rāmadéwa behind, [Rāma] then penetrated again into the vast
forest and arrived at the hermitage of the yogin Sutīkṣṇa.

time at the hermitage, because thc yogin loved him very much.

Śo after comforting (the mind) of Śūrpaṇakhā, he went away in a fash by
air. He took along with him his sword called candrahāsa. When he arrived
at the beach [of the continent] he came down,

to tell Marīca about the intention of his visit. On arrival he told Marīca
about his plans. Thus [Marīca] replied respectfully giving his advice out
of fear [of Rāma], because he had been defeated in the past. He was blown
away when shot at with a wind-producing-arrow.

«Oh, lord Daśānana, you will be destroyed if you fght [him]. That hero
of the Raghu race, Rāma, is really powerful, your sword Candrahmsa is
nothing [to him]. Therefore do not go near the ascetic Dāśarathi.

‘Raghūttama is an uneualled and outstanding archer, the irresistible terror
of the demonss and titans. Before, the bold ones were killed, their necks
severed by arrows. Khara, Dūṣaṇa and Triśirah were heroically killed.

He took part in the sugyambaru (contest) held by king Janaka. A bow wasṣ
placed in the middle of the arena. All the kings [present] were unable to
draw it, yet Raghūttama was able to draw and break it.

Thus were the words of Marica, urging him to return home by praising
Raghuttama as being exceedingly powerful with the intention of frightening
Daśānana to death. However, Daśamukha became angry and qguickly
replied:

You are insolent, Marica, your mind is debased, stupid and flthy. Your
words are rubbish, but you meanit. [You said] he defeated Paraśurāma.

Of course he was beaten, because he was old and Rāma in the prime of his
life.

Ikana si Tāṭakā pinĕjahanya taman sapujin,

a. D sapuji. d. AB hatma.

You should not praise him because he murdered Tāṭakā. She was a woman,
powerless and alone, yet she was cruelly killed by the arrows of Rāghawa
and unnecessarily. If that is what you praised, then you must like him
very much. O, get out !

32. Tuwi pinanah ni Rāghawa ta ko atikaṣṭa dahat,

*You were also shot at by Rāghawa and you were a lightweight (powerless).
It is because your mind was flled with terror, you were panic-stricken. His
arrow was not so strong, the wind was weak, but because you were afraid,
you ran away, even though nothing happened.

*You also praised the strength of Dāśarathi. He certainly broke the bow,
because it had been stored away for so long and was perforated and ruined
by woodworms. [The kings] who drew before him were very very weak.

a. D. puji. d. A nikaṅ.

The slaying of Triśira and Khara is not praiseworthy, because they were
indifferent so that they were killed. Ifthey had attacked Rāghawa fercely
and with all their might, certainly Rāghawa would have been killed in a
minute and without trouble.

‘Now, why did you praise the power of Rāghawa, you debased creature.
You want to betray [me], you want to desert me, you want to serve him.

His back was shining brightly, beautiful and smooth, the coat of his body
was radiant. He came near the place where Janakarājasutā (Sitā) was
resting. She became excited and surprised because [the deer] was so tame.

Iniṅĕt-iṅĕt nirāhayu kulit nya ksmul-kĕmula,

She thought that the coat of (the deer) would be nice to make a stole,
because it was shiny, with gold coloured fur, smooth and ñkne. Her heart

was thrilled by her desire to possess what she saw. So she asked [Rāma] to
obtain the golden deer for her.

Raghusuta tar wihaṅ juga asiṅ sapakon i sira,

a. A irya. c. CD tar.

Raghusuta was unreluctant to fulñl all her reḍuests. He lef his younger
brother Lakṣmaṇa to guard the hermitage and went to persue the deer, but
he could not catch it, as it lept around and around.

Kadi ya mariṅ mahā ya sakarĕṅ maṅadĕg maparo,

c. A alĕyĕp.

Then it seemed that it stopped intentionally for a while, standing nearby,
but as soon as [Rāma] tried to seiee it, it slipped away, because its fur waṣ

smooth and shiny as if it was oiled. His hands became numb as he missed
the deer once more, and it ran away again.

Ṣo he went further and further away chasing the deer and still could not
capture it, even when it stood still for a minute, teasing and taunting. Rāma
became impatient because he could not capture him. He drew his bow, and
shot it with an arrow.

Kadi hinarit higā nya mĕtu rāh nya usus nya mulū,

His ribs were slashed as if carved by a sickle, blood flowed and his intestines
came out. In the last seconds of his life he cried out to delude. The
daughter of Janaka (Sītā) hearing his clear cries was upset, as she thought
jt was the voice of the hero Rāma, asking for help.

Dadi manaṅis siraṅ Janakarājasutā ta mawīū,

So Sītā cried aloud. ®My brother Lakṣmaṇa, go and help your brother.
He called you to come and help. Why are you so heedless concerning your

Thus spoke Sītā crying, out of love, urged by her feelings. Then young
Lakṣmaṇa answered without fear, as he was convinced about the power of
his brother and that he would not be defeated in battle.

Thus he spoke, rendering a curse on her, then left uickly to follow his

So when she was picking flowers in the forest, Daśānana came in the disguise
of a hermit, a pure and holy Śiwaitic sage, looking truthful and serene. His
hair was shining, cut evenly except of a small pig-tail.

His teeth were very clean and white like crystals. He wore rosaries and
shouldered a gourd. His clothes of tree-bark were beautiful and red-coloured
like wax. His disguise, which was very hard to detect, was begging for
food.

He met Janakarājasutām in the forest. She was alone going into the under-

he came near her, at length he spoke respectfully:

*Who are you, o beautiful one, who enters the forest to pick ḍowers. How
unparalleled is your beauty, most perfect. Even the beauty of the moon is
no match for yours, because it waned at daytime and becomes ugly without
radiance.

“The Jotuses in the lake are in full bloom, they are beautiful, fragrant, and
white and red in colour, yet their beauty is no match [for yoursJ; their’s is
inferior, because they close up at nightfall and no longer look beautiful.

This place of yours is dangerous, thick and impassable, but you are not
afraid of venomous snakes and wild elephants. Who is your protector, I
ask, if there is a lion laying in ambush Take care of your beauty my

whipped the horses and the wagon fiew in the air. There he (Rāwaṇa)

was too heavy for him.- If he had not caught the princess, she surely would
have been killed in the fall. That was the reason why Jaṭāyu flew slower

was concerned that his numerous soldiers would be annihilated.

Ri laku nikana taṅ wwil cāra yāmratyawékṣa,

When the demon-spies had gone into operation, he went to propose to
Jānakī, who rejected him. She pointed at him with her lethand nger and
scorned him. Daśamukha was evil to his core. Without shame he approached
her.

Pratidina sira mojar ndan mahāsatya dèwi,

Everyday he proposed to her, but the princess was very loyal. Only
Raghutanaya was in her mind no one else. She moaned distressfully whilst
Daśāsya was pressing [with his reuest]. He ordered his soldiers to keep
an eye on Jānakī.

Atha ri hana niraṅ śrī Jānakī ṅkā ri Lĕṅkm,

So when Jānakī was in Leṅka, Raghūtanaya was in a gloomy and sad mood.
He saw a bad omen, telling him that Jānakī had disappeared, namely birds
meeting him on his way, delivering cries sounding like lamentation.

Daśarathasuta tībra glāna maṅlih makiṅkiṅ,

d. B kutaṅ. CDE ta kutan.

Daśarathasuta (the son of Daśaratha) was sad, weary and worried: cJanaka-
tanayā (daughter of Janaka) ah, how lucky [if] you are found l [Perhaps]
she has been devoured by a tiger or has fallen into a ravine, she is so
active. Ah, how pitiful

While confounded Rāghawa was in deep thought, there came his youngṣr
brother in a terrible statee He became more alarmed when he saw
Lakṣmaṇa like thus. ‘Certainly Maithilī is dead’, he said hopelessly.

Dadi ta sira matakwan śīghra mojar saṅ antĕn,

b. B mojar. bhakti. E bhaktr d. ABC hiḍĕp ya.

So he uickly asked his brother, who answered frankly informing him of his
loyalty and devotion to his older brother. Raghutanaya was upset when
he heard the story [of what had happened]. His heart was broken into
pieces, he thought the world was void.

Kadi ta hilaṅ umĕtwaṅ jīwa saṅké śarīra,

d. E his.

JIt was as if his soul had slipped away from his body, he could not think
because of his deep sorrow. He only thought of Jānakī, tears poured down
his cheeks continuously and uncontrollably.

Then wearily he stood up, wiped his streaming tears. He went to take a

of love, he did not forget to pray. It is this conduct that illustrates a true

fully, while offering fruits and a mixture of honey and milk.

covered [by the clouds], and [as a conseuence] was killed. Sugrīwa,
suffering from the heat of the sun, took shelter in the shadow of the clouds
(the arrows).

Rāmadéwa looked at the numerous troops of monkeys. They were at ease
and happy and showed their liveliness. All their movements, their noisy
voices, their way of sleeping on branches made him happy just to look at
them.

When their friendship was established, the outstanding and be friended
king of the apes spoke: ¢O, Rāghawa ! the monkey-king Bāli is extremely
powerful. There is no match for him in this threefold world.

The arrow went through seven trees in a line, and they were blown away
iṇ the direction of the arrow. Sugrīwa was amazed and rejoiced at the
sight of the palmtrees [testl. Lead by prince Rāma they departed for
Kiṣkindhā to go to the offensive.

Sugrīwa wanted to make an offering in the battleñeld. Bgmli was the

ofñciating priestt Tārā was the fortune that came as the result of the
offering which [Sugrīwa] would relish.

Afer travelling for a while, heading for the cave of Kiṣkindhā, Rāma and
Sugrīwa who was very fierce and impatience, saw the wide cave on the
slope of a mountain, deep and dangerous. It was the residence of Bāli
with its formidable dark aperture.

Sugrīwa uickly challenged his brother to come out to ight. Noisily he
roared wildly, with frowning eyebrows, calling aloud from outside. Bāli
came out of the cave and roared in reply, so that the sky and the ten

Growling loudly like a wild tiger he stepped forward, whilst Sugrīiwa, more
vehemently, was like a pouncing lion advanced with muzzle wide open
and a duel ensued, beating, scoring, biting each other and wrestling. They
slapped each other and pulled at each other’s hair, gnashing their teeth
with fury.

They scratched each other on the temple and thc hair was pulled out. With
bared teeth [they attacked each other], evading each other by turning
around or just their head, but at times they were caught in a combination
of punches and hissed loudly. Blood flowed down thcir cheeks and fell on
to their shoulder and broad chests which looked like red curcuma.

The longer the fight, the harder were the punches, they scraped each
other’s nose with their sharp nails. They snatched swiftly at each other
savagely, and when they fell on their knee they pulled at each otherīs tails.
They were hit on the jaws and wounded each other with their teeth. They
attempted a great variety of tricks, and whirled around each other.

Many yogins making their asceticism on the slopes of the mountains looked
on, not to mention their pupils, accompanying them who were packed
together. They went into the woods to gather flowers and stopped for a
while to join the crowd. Those monks who had pledged for silence were
carried away and forgetting their pledge they looked on noisily.

Rīma, once and again, watched the two who had been fighting for a long
time, but could not recognise Bali as he looked exactly like Sugrīwa.
Rāma was confused, the longer he looked the more confused he became.
His hands failed to put an arrow [on his bow] as he did not know who to
shoot.

Sugrīwa was tired and waiting impatiently for him to interfere. His body
was bruised black and blue, he was almost killed when he was flattened on
the ground with [Bāli on top of him]. When he freed his hand, it was hit
and clasped under the arms by Bāmli He withdrew ashamed, painful,
wounded and furious.

of admiration and adoration to Rāghawa. Sugrīwa’s devotion and respect
made Rāma happier and happier.

‘Ah, my lord, how great and unlimited is your mercy towards us, but we
cannot return it right away. Let it be delayed for a while, because the
rainy season has come, and the monkeys are troubled by the cold. With the
dry season we will search for Maithilī and destroy the enemy-

Thus were the words of the king of the monkeys, expressing his gratitude
to king Rāma. In the light of the trouble which had befallen the monkey-
troops, Raghuputra gave his agreement.

Sāmpun samayātūt, rĕṅ-rĕṅ ya ta hèrĕn,

After they agreed to wait for [the end of] the rainy season, Sugrīwa took
his leave to return to his palace.

After paying homage with folded hands, the king of the monkeys, his heart
flled with increasing joy, went away immediately together with his
monkey-troops to Kiṣkiṇḍa to enjoy the fruit [of victory]l. The rainy sea-
śon had come and the peacocks were mirthful.

When prince Rāghawa arrived at the mountain, his heart was flled with
sadness and anguish, caused by the blowing of a sot breeze heralding the
arrival of the rĕtu (rainy) season, giving rise to pangs of love.

The clouds suddenly began to collect in the sky, peals of thunder were
hooming loudly, like the drums of Manobhawa which agitated [the heart]
of those hearing it.

He saw a rainbow in the sky which looked like the colour of delusion. That
was the bow of Manobhawa, with which he shot at people who were sepa-

The herons were happily returning from the feld to their nests flying in
lines, white in colour. It is the withered owers of Manmatha, and every-
one seeing it, will tremble in his heart.

śSad is the heart of the pessimist who sees only darkness all around, dark-

When all the monkey-troops had assembled, Māruti, Nīla, Aṅgada, Jāmba-
wān, and all the commanders of the monkeys went forward. They were
heroic in the strife to accomplish their task which was diffcult as the four
ocean were very deep. The king of the monkeys Sugrīwa spoke to them.

*Hey Nīla, Aṅgada, Jāmbawānl Go and accompany Mgāmruti who will be
ordered to ascertain whether gueen Sītā is in fact at the palace of Lĕṅkm.
That is the purpose, and this is theway. Go southward from Mālyawān
along the slopes of the mountains and press on until you come to the south
sea.

éAfter you pass the ocean look for the mountain of Suwéla. When you
arrived there, stay there overnight. Be on guard! Sleep in turns. There
are many wild demons roaming there at night-time. So, that is why you
have to be careful. And when you [ñnd] Janakātmajā (the daughter of
Janaka) in the city of Lĕṅkā, observe her.

‘Do not speak to her openly when you find Maithilr (the princess of
Mithilā) Enter the guarters secretly, look to north and south. If you see
a lady in sorrow and distress and weeping, come forward and guestion her.
But if she is talking [to others] listen [to her],

b. C amri-mriha.

Thus said the king of the monkeys. Then in turn Rāghawa spoke: *Hey
Maāruti, be careful in all your movements while you are in Lĕṅkā. Take
along this ring of mine, give it to Maithilī when you fnd her. The pur-
pose is that she will then believe that you are my messenger.

Thus said king Rāghawa. Then Māmruti stood up and went. Besides N1la,
Aṅgada and Jāmbawān there were 40,000 monkeys accompanying him.
They jumped into the air, their red fur shone; like the energy of ten thou-
sand suns was their power.

After the departure of the messengers, Śatabali, a powerful monkey stood
up and went swiftly to the north. Susêna went to the west, whilst Winata
went to the east. They jumped swifly away, followed by one million
monkeys who were like playful lions.

So all the monkeys went their ways at Rāghawas order. Let us tell about
those going to the south, under the leadership of Pawanasuta (son of the
Wind-god).

Krama tĕka taṅ kapibala riṅ, giriwara Windhya ya maruhur,

Then these monkey-troops came at the excellent and high mountain of
Windhya. Tigers and lions were afraid, and dispersed to all direction at
full speed.

The top of the mountain was dangerous, with many rivers and ravines full

the monkey-troops.

They made uproar in the woods, they rushed through the undergrowth.
The lions were surpriscd, and deafened they ran away.

Saka ri sukĕt nikanaṅ alas, tuwi giri Windya ya maruhur,

Because the forests were so impenetrable, and the mountain of Windhya
was so high, the monkeys were exhausted and complained about the extreme
heat of the sun.

the monkeys fearlessly entered [the cave] together to find shade.

When the monkeys were inside, they came to a house, white and shining
very brightly. They went forward,

very clear and cool. These were her offerings [to the monkeys], pure and
sweet.

Furthermore it seemed that the ocean was drunk, it was in high spirit
because of the jewels and precious stones found there in plenty. Of all

c. B tamāttar.

Thereafter Pawanātmaja fashed away through the air. Garuḍa, Sūryya
(the Sun-god) and the wind were no eual [to him], as his speed was astoni-
shing like the speed of the mind.

A long time before, the Wind-god made friends with him, so that [at
length] he became the unegualled friend of Bāyu (the Windgod). He knew
that Marutprasūta (Hanūmān) was Bāyutanaya (the son of Bmyu). So res-
pectfully he welcomed him with the words.

Thus said the mountain, wishing to hold up Hanūmān. Because he was

was really powerful and that was why she dared to act brutally.

[For example] there was an umbrella ornamented with pearls and precious

looked resplendent.

A golden pavillion was reserved for her, but she preferred to lay down on

Her mind was disturbed when she was tormented by many evil she-demons,
who had no consideration at all for people living in separation. They
ṭeased her because she was overwhelmed by pangs of longing, noisily they
abused her, [mocking] her with amorous glances and praise.

When they arrived at the garden they yelled, booming like peals of thunder.
Pawanasuta was angered, his face turned terrible, even the thunder at
doomsday would be silenced because of fear [of him].

The demons with their troops were like a river, coming closer, thundering
and rumbling like a flood. Pawanasuta was frm like an ocean, even if the
floods reached it everyday, it would not become full.

The gate of the pleasure garden was tall and [nearby] there was a katimaṅ-
tree a armspan in circumference and very tough. So Hanūmāan climbed on
to it, facing the approaching demon-troops.

The demon-soldiers [were taking positions], some were sguatting, some were
lying on their stomach. Others were shaking the tree forcefully while
looking up. The missiles thrown [at Hanūmān] fiew over him. Others were
shooting with arrows while another group were throwing theirlances at him.

There was a sandelwood tree, tall and large. Its circumference was one

vomiting blood, and their bodies were scattered on the ground.

There were others who were limping slightly, after the flogging. Their

Some were missed and ran home as guickly as possible without looking

Then there came other demon-warriors, who made a counter attack,
approaching swiftly and well-armed. They were mounted on elephants,
wagons and horses. Savagely they attacked and stabbed together.

Pawanasuta was more angered [by them] and roared, his large, long tail
stood erect and swelled up as the hair bristled straight. He climbed back
on to the katimaṅ-tree and perched [on a branch].

Menacingly the demons looked up, and threw stones as big as a water-
buffalo [at him]. The chest of Māruti was hit and made a cracking sound,
but it did not hurt at all.

Another demon riding on an elephant dashed forward. He stabbed at him
but failed to hurt him, because he stepped [aside] swiftly. The demon
turned cowardly as he saw Hanūmān so ñerce. He jumped off his ele-
phant and fled away.

Hanūmān struck at the head of the elephant. Its brains spattered around

ferocious, like a wild lion.

The infantery units of the demon-army marched forward in turn, to make
a counter-attack, as they did not want to retreat. ‘Those running home
are cowards, they said, while attacking and rampaging together.

When the demon-army was destroyed, Hanūmān stood up in high-spirits.

with their branches looked as tall as the Méru mountain of the Himalayas.
The trees were of sparkling gold, and they had many bowing branches
with twigs of one armspan in circumference.

stomach was not hurt, [on the other hand] the arrow was smashed on
impact.

dragging the drunken doves and the turtle-doves along, following the
parrots which were always frightened by the appearance of hairy monkeys
and wanted to fly away together with the peacocks, followed by starlings

The rabbits were frightened and dispersed in every direction, sadly they hid
ṭthemselves there under the dense saruṇi-shrubs with thick and dcnse leaves.
Quietly they penetrated therc to hide, their bodies sweating, and wanted
to stretch themselves on the ground to rest. But there was a muskdeer,
shaking [his wet coat] and jumping. The rabbits were startled and fled

away swiflly. The yaks were fleeing together in lines, not too guick but
attractive to see appeared to move slowly and calmly. The elephants
faltered forth wearily, as they were burdened by their stomachs. They
could not stretch themselves out [to rest] though exhausted, they breathed
heavily, their necks heavy, and their tongues hanging out moved feebly
while they moaned. The deer wildly leapt away but an anteater did not
want to follow, because he trusted his strong hide. He penetrated into a
bush, but was angered at the sight of a porcupine wanting to mate with his
female, lying down underneath a pandanus-ower. ‘Ah, how disgusting,
said the anteater and penetrated into other undergrowths. The beauty of
the garden was hnished, all the animals living there were pitiable. Like-
wise was the fruit, its sweetness wasted, as it fell, to the ground shaken by
Hanūmān, and trodden, the juice came out, as if the fruit were sadly
weeping, because it was misformed and suashed.

After Hanūmān had demolished the parijāta-trees, he took a rest at the
western gate of the garden. waiting for the infuriated demons. He had
even thought of the possibility that Daśāsya would fight him.

Thus he said to himself. Not long afterwards, prince Indrajit, famous
throughout the world as the most powerful son of Daśāsya, came. 1It was
known throughout the world that Méghanāda was very courageous.

He was furious at the death of Akṣa [before] and pledged to kill Bāyuputra.
Without delay he marched forward well-armed and ordered his soldiers to
fight bravely.

His wagon was amazingly large, wide and fast, drawn by harnessed horses.
There were a lot of arrows in his wagon as his demon-guards formed the
advance-guards.

He came in the garden with sizzling speed. The garden became more
devastated as the flowers were blown by the wind [of his wagon]. Hanūmān
saw him and came to meet him. He beckoned Indrajit and spoke without
delay:

Thus said Māruti to Méghanāda, who taking position with all his extremely
savage soldiers, simultaneously shot at Hanūmĕn confdently. They aimed
at him with all kinds of arrows.

Their arrows were sharp and kell like a shower, but they did not hurt
Hanūmā;n, but were smashed on impact. It looked like heavy rain falling
down on a rocky mountain, they were completely shattered.

Because of the great number of soldiers of Méghanāda, they looked like
rumbling and thundering dark [clouds], advancing simultaneously to attack
and destroy. Hanūmān was exactly like the sun breaking the clouds down.

Māruti became more excited. He took a branch of a tree and used it to
beat the advancing demons. The demons were confused to see him in
different shapes, amazed and stupefied to see him in different numbers.

At one moment Hanūmān was one, at another moment he was one thou-
sand in number. When he was attacked he flew up and stayed in the sky.
The demons chased him up in the sky, and very swiñly Hanūmān was
already down on the ground [again].

They descended together to chase Hanūmān and on the ground they began
to attack. Again Hanūmān flew up and the demons were too late. They
looked up, they moaned as they were tired.

They became more and more exhausted, breathing heavily and wearily.

Mgāmruti took advantage of their tiredness. He picked up a branch of a
pārijāta-tree and beat them up and reduced them to pulp.

When the demons of his bodyguards were slain, Indrajit advanced, his

with sharp arrows, but they did no harm to him, they became blunt on

When the demon-battle array was ready, each soldier holding either a

b. C Bāyuputré.

Indrajit saw it and was very infuriated when he saw the courage of Bāyu-
putra in battle. He drew his bow into perfect shape and shot at Hanūmān
with a nāgapāśa (snake-issuing arrow).

The arrow changed into a enormous snake, as big as a palm-tree and its
length was immeasurable, its fangs were pointed and exceedingly terrifying,
and when it opened its mouth, the teeth were like the bgjra (lightning).

This snake wound around the shoulders of Bāyuputra, pressed in the rihs
(breast), clinched the thighs together and bound them around down to the
knees. Hanūmā;n fell in the grip of the nāgapāśa (snake-arrow).

But it was not of his poor strength that he was tied up. For sure the pāśa

So, as the tail of Hanūmān was burning, Hanūmān's body swelled up to the
size of the Méru mountain. The snake-arrow broke into hundreds of pieces,
torn into bits and pieces by Hanūmān's hands. Bāyuputra uickly flew up
in the sky followed by a heavy wind blowing steadily and roaring like

his fight which resembled the goddess of Earth, flying together with the
well-known and horrible Fire of Doom (Kālāgni) heading for the buildings

urinated in their clothes, feebly clutching the kain of their maids who
were also groaning and moaning with fear.

The ponds in the palace compound had stone-banks studded with candrakānta-
precious stones and jewels [formerly], now they were dry, the water evapo-

and dried up, sadly the birds were weeping and the young cakrawāka-birds
were crying, the snipes were in grief, the swans were hopeless and sad, while
the animals in the ponds were in uproar.
