THE OBSERVANCE OF THE NIGHT OF §1WA4

Hail! May there be no hindrance.

Canto 1.

1. To the God of Gods in His immaterial form does one accomplished
in poetic arts direct his inmost thoughts;

In material form He is everlastingly enthroned in the midst of the
heart-lotus.

One practises meditation, sings songs of praise, repeats the highest
religious formula, murmurs prayers, and forms gestures of
the hands at this stage,

Whereas all that my heart is striving for is to be granted to go on
to world-conquest in Beauty.

2. I know how fruitless my musing was while I wandered absorbed
in the beauties of shore and mountain,

So I now aspire to win the merit of writing a kakawin, and make
bold to arrange my words in order.

Its aim will be to ensure that he over whom poets break their pens
in two may be prosperous, and that he may continue to be
honoured by his subjects,

For he is none other than Sri Adi-Suraprabhiwa, a king who is
worthy to be a scion of the line of Girindra.

3. But I myself am far from being endowed with the talent of com-
posing sweet-sounding words in verse,

For how could I achieve all that a poet longs for, exceedingly dull
as I am?

Thus indeed I cannot but incur the utmost derision of others;

My one hope, however, is that this may succeed in being an aid
in my search for the Absolute.

Canto 2.

1. Here begins the tale to which those discerning in the poetic arts

should lend their ear —

The story runs that there was once a hunter, and it is said that
he was known by the name of Lubdhaka.

He always dwelt among the mountain peaks, in sublime, charming
and delightful surroundings,

And, free from troubles, he simply enjoyed himself there with wife
and children.

TRANSLATION 71

. From the time of his earliest youth he had never observed the
moral law or acquired religious merit,

But rather had always engaged in hunting, killing the tiger, boar,
elephant and rhinoceros.

He had killed all kinds of wild animals, hunting them down so
that they could not escape with their lives;

This then was his means of providing for his children, his wife,
and sundry other relatives,

. The fourteenth day of the dark half of the seventh month had ar-
rived, bringing the rainy weather which arouses poetic feelings.

On that day he set forth in the morning to hunt, wearing a hunter's
jacket of dark(-blue) cloth.

When he was equipped with the gear for hunting game, and all
was ready,

Then he set out all alone, carrying his bow and arrows in his hand.

. His journey took him to the north-east, where the ravines were
lovely to look down into;

The gardens, ring-communities, sanctuaries, retreats and her-
mitages aroused his wonder.

There lay large fields at the foot of the mountains, with crops of
many kinds growing along the slopes;

A large river descended from the hills, its stream irrigating the
crops.

. Now there was a village which he also viewed from above, lying
below in a valley between the ridges.

Its buildings were fine to behold, while the lalan roofs of the
pavilions were veiled in the drizzling rain.

Wisps of dark smoke stretched far, trailing away in the sky,

And in the shelter of a banyan tree stood the hall, roofed with
rushes, always the scene of many deliberations.

. To the west of this were mountain ridges covered with rice-fields,
their dikes running sharp and clear.

The gardens were close together and laid out in rows, and the
many coconut palms were all shaded by mist.

A heron’s wings glistened as it flew along, faintly visible in the
distance in the midst of the clouds;

Then it disappeared, apparently merging with the mist, for it was
finally lost from view.

. To the side of this there was a monastery overlooking a large river,
the waters of which were deep;

Its portal stood out pure and clean, and the earthen wall was high,
running around it without a break.

The tafijun, campaka, bana and ndgakusuma trees spread a soft
fragrance, as their flowers were in full bloom,

And all along the wall they stood, beautifully arranged in rows,
the bees humming all the while.

TRANSLATION 73

8. Within there were elegant pavilions roofed with aren fibre, like

the scene in a painting;

The tender shoots of the jarigha spilling freely over the eaves were
twined together, and its flowers were sweetly fragrant.

The petals of the katasiga were sprinkled over the roofs, for they
had fallen in the wind,

Like maidens with flowers arranged in their hair, delighting those
who saw them.

9. On the northern side were well-kept places for offerings in their

bare courtyard, bright and green;

The shrines were lofty and were obscured by wreaths of morning
mist,

All was still except for the crying of the tree-beetles; the sound
of their shrill voices moved one’s heart;

The penetrating note of the conch could be heard, loud and con-
tinuous, sounding in unison with the prayer-bells.

Canto 3.

1. A great temple<complex from ancient times rose near a mountain

stream, and the path there was lonely.

The curved trunks of the water-elephants had fallen and crumbled,
and for lack of care its wall had almost tumbled down.

The monster-heads seemed to be weeping as their covered faces
were overgrown with a profusion of creepers,

And as though sad and weary the temple-guardians were lying
rolled over flat on the ground.

2. The pavilions in its courtyard were in ruins; some of the buildings
were now only wreckage, while others were rotting away ;
Their roofs were broken and had fallen in, and beyond repair their
pillars stood askew, swaying back and forth.
Heart-rending was the spectacle of the reliefs ; young maidens were
standing gazing skywards,
As if proclaiming their grief at being abandoned and no more visited

by wandering poets.

3. The tower-temple soared on high, and its pinnacles served as a

gathering-place for weeds;

The sides were cracked, overgrown by a shady fig-tree which spread
luxuriantly.,

All the subordinate figures were cracked by a fearsome tangle of
vines,

And only the main deity within was immovably in place, standing
firm in the centre of its pedestal.

TRANSLATION 75

. Many of the buildings had fallen in ruins, and all the spouts were
choked and flowed no more;

Likewise the pool and its original appointments were none of them
in their former condition.

The scene was still, without a trace of anyone coming to visit the
deserted courtyards;

The blossoms of the kamunin trees, dropping and spreading them-
selves about, were scolded by the buzzing bees.

. To the north-east were freshly tended gardens, delighting and
refreshing the heart of the beholder;

The steps in the path were overgrown by kanaka trees and croton
bushes.

All around there were many kinds of fragrant flowers, all of them
blossoming and having the freshness of youth;

This alone was a favourite refuge for people running away with
a sweetheart,

. On the steep, rocky slopes pavilions shaped like mushrooms seemed
to be hidden, standing in the neighbourhood of springs;

The water descended in thin, clear streams, and lit by the rays of
the sun looked like a rainbow.

The current ran swift and pure, forming a little lake, and along
its banks there stood pidada and rdjasa trees in bloom;

The twisted roots of the trees covered the rocks overgrown with
plants, which waved to and fro as the water washed over them.

. Water came out along the sides of the rocks in rivulets, channelled
through bamboo pipes.

Musical water-mills played hesitantly, accompanying the conver-
sations of the frogs in the crevices.

Where the water seeped coolly downward below this there spread
red ferns mixed with green;

There were panpun, pangaga and mountain pacar trees in full
bloom along the verges of the marsh.

. There was water gushing from the cracks in the rocks, creating
a mysterious and beautiful effect.

There were impressive spouts carved out in rows, inspiring feelings
of delight.

The stream was limpid, tumbling over ledges faced with splendidly
ornamented stonework, making a lovely sight;

On the banks spread asoka and ta7ijusn trees in full bloom, and
flowers of the surabhi floated on the surface.

. Pandan-wwan trees hung down over the rocks, with an air of
sadness, quite wrapped in the mist.

How they longed to be visited by the thunder, which would bring
with it the rushing of the rain!

As if downhearted they let their petals droop, petals on which some-
one had jotted down some poetry in a moment of inspiration;

For this was admirable as a place for a wandering poet to link
together his verses.

10.

TRANSLATION 77

But when the time had come for the sun to sink, its splendour
would begin to fade, dimmed by the haze;

Then there would be soft clouds covering the sky and bringing
forth a gentle rain.

The calls of the kalankyan, crying out in the sky in their deep-felt
longing for a heavy downpour, would touch one’s heart,

Seeming to tell of the sorrow of nature at not being visited by the

wanderer.
11. And so he strolled happily on along the mountain-side viewing the
charms of the seashore;
Only faintly could he see the waters of the sea below, seeming to
merge with the heavens.
A row of trees stood out along the water’s edge, wrapped in a
blanket of fog;
The heavy rain was flanked by a rainbow in the sky which seemed
to be vying with the brightness of the sun.
12. Now an island, dimly visible in the distance, was just being
engulfed by the rain;
It disappeared, lost in the clouds and enveloped in mist, growing
obscurer till finally blotted out.
Now there were only flashes of lightning, flickering now and then
on the horizon,
And the muffled sound of thunder echoing back and forth un-
ceasingly.
13. There was a ship heading for the open sea, as if about to disappear
into the sky —
No longer clear, then all at once gone, it appeared again for a
moment in the rays of the sun.
When the rain arrived it finally faded in the distance, still glinting
faintly now and then;
Then it vanished for good, and was lost in the gloom of the mists
which were veiling the glow of the sun.
Canto 4.
1. Many were the things to be seen below, but it would take too long

to describe their beauties,

And moreover Lubdhaka had already gone on his way, and had
passed many pleasant sights,

He had reached the mountain forests which were frequented by
all kinds of animals,

And were exceedingly wild ; they looked so uncanny that they made
one shudder.

TRANSLATION 79

2. There he stopped and then prepared his arrows, stringing his bow
ready for use;
He was determined that none of the quarry he might encounter
should escape him.
With satisfaction he looked at the glories of the mountains with
their dense tangle of undergrowth;
“A lot of animals must be lurking there!” he thought, without any
doubt in his mind.
. After this he made a circuit in search of the places where animals
would gather;
He travelled far, passing through rugged mountains, ravines and
precipitous places.
But there was no trace of wild animals to be found — he saw
nothing ;
He was perplexed, for his hunting had never been like this before.
4. He continued his journey further and further, looking for game
but finding none;
As he had persisted in his wanderings so long, in the end he was
tired and aching.
He was hungry too, as he had not eaten since he first set out from
home, and midday had gone by;
He did not know what to do, for if he returned home what would
he then find in the way of food?
5. This he thought to himself, and that was why he set off again
pushing through the woods;
As much as four leagues he went, without seeing a single animal.
It was already sunset when he happened to come across a large
lake;
Here our Lubdhaka bathed, washed his face and drank of the cool,
flowing water.
6. Thereupon he made up his mind to spend the night at that purest
of pools;
Indeed there was no time to return, for the path was exceedingly
hazardous in the dark.
He hoped, moreover, that there would be animals coming soon to
drink of the water;
This was the idea in his mind; so he put it into action and made
ready a place to sleep.

Canto 5.

1. Then at the setting of the sun all the trees seemed to be shivering

and shaking;

They were enshrouded in mist as if wrapped in a blanket, being
cold with the falling dew.

The call of the cucur was softly audible, followed by the weeping
of the tadah-asih;

They felt they would die if the moon did not return to help them
on their weary way.

w

TRANSLATION 81

. All the beauties of the woodlands appeared sad at the departure
of the thousand-rayed one;

Here the bamboo was sighing in the wind, paying no heed to her
clothing ;

The weeping of the sundari echoed forlornly in the trees, sobbing
and pitiful;

And here the blossoms of the trees were casting themselves into
the ravines, falling at the touch of the bees,

. Let us now say no more of what the woodlands were like when
thick darkness fell;

For then the hunter climbed onto the branch of a bael tree, so that
he hung over the lake.

Carrying his bow and arrows with him he sat ready on the limb
of the tree,

Lying in wait for animals coming to drink water and to be shot
by him.

. Although he waited quite some time, there came not a single
creature ;

At about the third hour it happened that a great heaviness came
over his eyes, which was quite irresistible.

From fear that he would drop off to sleep and without doubt fall
from his refuge,

And would certainly be killed by the rhinoceroses, wild bulls and
lions, as he said to himself,

. He finally sought a means of warding the heaviness from his eyes
out of fear of falling asleep;

So he plucked the leaves of the bael tree, and without ceasing
dropped them in the deep water.

In the midst of the pool, now, there was a lingga of Siwa, not
fashioned by human hands,

And that was where all the bael leaves fell, although he did not
mean it so.

. While he did this there were even so no animals to be seen coming,

Because the great power of his penance was counteracted by his
evil nature,

He had never carried out good works, observed the moral law or
done penance, and his ways were very impure;

It was only because of his fear he might fall that he did not sleep
the whole night through.

. There is no need to tell any further of how he fought off sleepiness,
for it was clearly overcome;

There came now the first faint glow of day, and the gentle blowing
of a cooling breeze.

The sky became red in the east, like the kain of a girl in love,
loosened and stained with blood ;

And the stars blinked in the sky, like the eyes of the girl deflowered
at first union.

TRANSLATION 83

Canto 6.

1.

Then it was day, and the holy sun emerged to roll back the mists,

And all the tender shoots of the trees sparkled, freshly opened.

Birds amused themselves among the branches, happily twittering
to each other,

Like a meeting of experts in esoteric truth debating together.

The appearance of the trees all in full bloom made one ache with
love,

And the bamboo opened her dress for the jengha vine to embrace
her.

The bees drew near to caress the flowers of the rara malayu,

And in agitation the bamboos sighed, passionately kissing each
other.

The wilted flowers fell, disturbed by a soft wind,

And the young branches fluttered in the breeze.

The kissing of the flowers was incessant, while the bees busily
flew about,

And darting sideways would hover beneath the slender lira% palms.

Canto 7.

1.

Let us now pass over the beauties of the charming woodlands,

And return to the story of what happened to Lubdhaka.

He wished to return home that morning, and so made ready his
bow and arrows;

When he was ready he presently went on his way.

The charms of everything along the way will not be described ;
He passed over all the paths of the previous day.

When he arrived home the sun was on the point of setting,
Then his wife came out to meet him, and said:

“My dear, where is what you brought home from the hunt?

Your children have been miserable, for none of them has eaten.

I did not know what to give them when they were hungry,

But now you have arrived we are all delighted to come and meet
you.”

TRANSLATION 85

Canto 8.

1.

“I had no success at hunting, mother, there was not a thing abroad ;

You set your heart on what I would bring back, but all to no avail.

Yesterday I scoured the woods high and low and had nothing to
eat all day,

Nor closed an eye all night, sitting there on the branch of a tree.

. “My lodging-place was extremely perilous, dear, in a tree on the

bank of a lake;
I would surely have been killed if I had fallen from my place.
I was watching and waiting for animals to come and drink, but
there were none;
It is so wretched for you, dear, that I have nothing to give you.”
Thus spoke the hunter, and his wife gently replied:
“Father, never do such a thing again, courting death so obstinately !
It breaks my heart to hear your tale of all that happened on your

way,

What would become of the bereaved if you should die, and where
would they turn to?”

So she spoke while giving her exhausted husband some water,

And offered him a little food, too; thus did she bear herself toward
her loved one.

He then ate and his great tiredness disappeared and he looked
refreshed ;

After that they prepared for sleep, the sun having already set.

. We need pay him no heed as he slept, having fallen under the

sway of drowsiness;

There now fell a gentle rain, together with thunder responding in
turns in north and south.

The flash of the lightning low in the sky on the edge of a dark
rain-cloud

Was like the quiver of a girl's eyebrows as she partook of the
raptures of love-making.

. The rain ceased when day was about to break, just after the

seventh hour;

The fallen flowers were strewn in the courtyard, beautiful as the
faded blossoms from a maiden’s hair.

The sound of the hepin was like the crying of one who had just
been introduced to the sensations of love,

And the creaking of the ivory bamboo in the wind was as the
sighing of one beset by sorrow.

When, at the departure of night, the sun emerged from the glowing
eastern mountain,

The hunter was ready, and turned his mind to his previous work,

And having recalled his usual way of life, he would enjoy himself
with his household and other relatives;

This is how he conducted himself, constantly satisfying all the
desires of the senses.

TRANSLATION 87

Canto 9.

L

There passed a certain length of time; then, after a number of years

Death came by way of a terrible illness which struck him inexorably.

It made the fever increase, the incurable sickness overwhelmed him,
and he grew worse and worse;

Those watching over him were desperate, and his wife and children
wept for him as they sat at his feet.

. His malady grew ever graver, and there was no remedy which

gave relief ;

He was pale and had no strength to rise; he had not the slightest
desire for food.

There was nothing he wanted to eat, and even chewed food stuck
fast;

With closed eyes he lay still, groaning again and again, and when
asked of his illness only shook his head without answering.

His wife was extremely distressed, and wept and wailed and beat
her breast;

Moreover she was sorry for the children, for what was to become
of them if he should leave them so?

This is why she embraced her children and wept for them in turns,
bending over them;

Her wails were choked by overflowing grief, fading under a flood
of tears.

“O my children, what will you do if you are bereaved of your
father?

There will be no-one to care for my poor children; who will give
them anything to eat?

Who is there among our family who can take your place as a
father, my lord?

It makes my heart ache, and I cannot bring myself to behold your
pitiable state.”

Such was the plaint of the hunter's wife, pitiful and muffled to
the ear;

Let us now tell how her husband could not bear the terrible sharp-
ness of the pain:

He was wretched while his heart-beat faltered and vanished through
his throat,

For he had not fulfilled the least part of the moral law as a release
for his soul, and that is why he was in such a state.

After the hunter had died all his relatives wept, making a fearful
din —

Not to mention the sorrow of his wife as she lamented, almost
swooning while she bent over the body.

Stifled and deep were her moans, and unceasingly her tears welled
up and ran down her cheeks,

While she lamented of her misery : “Why should you take no notice
of my wretched state, look at me!

TRANSLATION 89

7. “Oh my husband, look at me and see how miserable your servant
is;
Where, I wonder, should I seek your life? Should I pursue it
through the woods?
If you are looking for game, let me follow in your footsteps all
along your way;
Even into the wildest parts of the mountains, let me be your con-
stant companion wherever you may go.
8. “Oh, when I think of all you would do, my love, when the seventh
hour was come,
When you returned from your wanderings and would never fail
to ask after the children as a father ought;
Then I would go to meet you, and would ask what you had brought
home from the wood —
All the game you had caught, the lalab, the sirih and betel-nuts,
these you would give to me.
9. “But now that you are gone who will take pity on my lot, oh
beloved?
And where is the one who will care for your children, for they,
poor things, must endure great hardships?
They will feel the keenness of affliction, and there will be none
to comfort their sadness;
Only death will satisfy me, no matter where I may have to accom-

pany you.”

Canto 10.

1. Such were her lamentations while she wept, melting the very core
of one’s heart;
The deceased was covered with a shroud and was borne along the
slopes of the mountains.
His relatives, who had come, accompanied him in a line along the

path;
He was cremated and when he had turned to ashes those who came
with him returned to their homes.

Canto 11.

1. Let us pass over in silence what became of them,
For it is the soul of the hunter of which we shall speak.
There in the air he was sorrowful and pitiable;
He knew not for which destination he should head.

2. While he thus moved on in the sky,
The god Siwa caught sight of him in such a state.
He knew well all that he had done on earth,
And that he would be brought to the abode of Yama.

TRANSLATION 91

. And so he called upon the Ganas to hasten, every one,

And at once they came, bringing their homage at the feet of the
World-Lord ;

“What is this task for us to perform, oh divine Lord?

For we are apprehensive at being all summoned thus.

. “We imagine that there must be an enemy near at hand,
And that this is why the Lord summons us to hasten.
We should therefore now like to be told

Of the difficult task which he requires of us.”

. Thus spoke the bands of Ganas, full of reverence,
And then said the Lord — his glance was mild:
“Forgive this summons of mine;

What you must do for me is no great burden.

. “Listen to what I have to say to you all —

I have an order for you to carry out:

There is the soul of a hunter who was steadfast in his vow;
Go and meet him, and bring him here to me.

. “If there is anyone who resists, and refuses to hand him over —
For it is evident what the inclination of Yama’s hosts will be —
Do not be afraid to seize that Lubdhaka,

And convey him to the abode of Siwa.”

. Thus spoke Lord Iswara, kindly and gently,

And reverently all the Ganas answered :

“Why, our lord, do you feel obliged to force

The murderous soul of Lubdhaka to come hither?

. “For he has done nothing but kill animals all his life,

And has not carried out even the smallest vow by way of penance.

What then would be the point of his coming to the abode of Siwa?

It would be fairer if he were to end up in the Cow-Headed
Cauldron.

TRANSLATION 93

10. “Furthermore the Kinkaras are not so careless
As to chain those who are always of good conduct and loyal to
their vows.
For they are mindful of their mission and do not mistake
Those who go to heaven and who to the abode of Yama.”

Canto 12.

1. Such were the words of all the Ganas, and Lord I$wara spoke,
“Well, there is in fact a vow he kept during his life on earth;
The great excellence of his vow is spoken of by all the world,
And the leading scriptures always stress that the Night of Siwa is

meritorious beyond compare.
2. “That is why I must send you all to seek the soul of the hunter,
For he has fulfilled the exalted law and the vow in a most excellent
way.

Take the splendid Jewelled Chariot along as his vehicle when he
comes ;

Go quickly and do not hesitate to do all that I have said, and waste
no time about it!”

3. Thus spoke Sankara, and then those who received his orders took

their leave to go;

Swiftly preparing they called up their troops, who came forth in
order onto the square, fully fitted out.

Drums and gongs boomed, music echoed loudly, and the banners
were raised.

And in front there stood the splendid Jewelled Chariot, accom-
panied by the arméd hosts.

Canto 13.

1. Then when the whole army came forth to carry out the orders of
the divine I$wara,
They filled the heavens on their way, and the air resounded.
Their glittering pennants flashed as they fluttered in the force of
the wind,
And their thundrous passage through the heavens was like the
final destruction of the world drawing near.
2. The Ganas clamoured in the firmament in incalculable numbers,
capable in battle;
Because they were skilful and had been well trained, they had been
formed into a corps of guards for Ganapati.
They all shouted and yelled loudly, in no mood to evade enemy
heroes;
They would always crush an enemy and overwhelm him in battle,
a thorn in the side of an approaching foe.

TRANSLATION 95

3. The vanguard was formed by Nandana, skilled and steadfast in
the struggle,
And after him came Urdhwakesa, together with Ganaratha and
Puspadanta too,
All heroes in battle, who would never yield before the strength of
an enemy ;
Their army seemed a hundred million strong, in its various regi-
ments, each of them mighty.
Canto 14.
1. Others than these also knew the hardships of battle, and possessed
discernment and insight into the correct procedure:
Their names were Pingaliksa and Mahodara, together with Wira-
bhadra,
As well as Somawarna and Renukarna and, besides, Prakarsa;
These were appointed as generals over the troops of Ganas, and
had again and again won themselves fame on the battlefield.
2. All the Ganas were exceedingly handsome, with their brightly
shining attire;
The apparel of these, the most prominent of divine warriors, was
extremely beautiful ;
The sun paled and closed his eyes on seeing the multitude of coronet
jewels glittering,
And the earth would certainly have become dark, were it not lit
by their splendid attire,
3. Together they went forth through the heavens with their troops,
making a terrible uproar,
It seemed as if the whole world would collapse, shuddering at the
army's shouting and yelling.
The clamour of the cymbals, drums, kettledrums, and the conches
being blown thundered tumultuously,
And was joined with the voices of the numberless army, as they
vied with each other in shouting.
4. While they were on their way through the sky in dense swarms,
making a boisterous noise,
Let us tell how the god Dharma was sending forth his excellent
troops, when he had called them up:
“Set out straight away and seize the soul of Lubdhaka and bring
him to the dwelling of Yama;
You must bind him without giving quarter; make haste, for he
has always had evil deeds to his name.”
Thus spoke the lord Dharma, and all his armies then paid their
homage,
Summoning their servants to bring up the tackle for seizing the
vile hunter.
They were in ranks on the great square, wild with impatience and
each one carrying his weapons;
They were longing to get the soul of the hunter, to torment him
and injure him in any way they could.

TRANSLATION 97

Canto 15.

1.

At their departure they emerged from their houses, frenzied and
shrieking frightfully all together;

They were terrifying in appearance and brandished their spears,
discuses and swords, keen-edged and sharp.

Their attire was splendid, their faces were fearful and threatening,
as a lion's,

Their tusks were like iron and constantly ground together, their
friction bringing forth fire.

Canda was the first to go on his way, together with the fearful
Pracanda;

Kila, Paramestimrtyu, as well as Nila and Ugrakarna, accompanied
them,

And Citrodumbara, Ghorawikrama, Mahicanda and Antaka —
very frightful —

All those who emerged from Yama’'s dwelling were glorious in
every way, and their peerless attire gleamed.

Their men were some hundreds of millions in number, and they
were indeed mighty heroes on the battlefield,

Following behind in ranks, their voices booming loudly, and in-
spiring terror.

They carried with them their razor-sharp lances and cleavers; each
one had his own weapons;

They thundered in the sky like the sea about to engulf the land.

They sped unswervingly onward till they came to their destination;

There they found the miserable hunter, who knew not whither he
should turn.

He was afraid and did not know what to do when he saw the bands
of Kinkaras;

Quaking and desperate he helplessly fell to his knees, and wept
bitterly in his misery.

When they reached him, the Kinkaras pointed threateningly and
jeered at him while they attacked him from all sides, saying:

“Hey you base and worthless Lubdhaka, you certainly have a lot
to answer for!

Look me in the face, don't just sit there, look at the staff in my
hand!

It will surely beat you, so resign yourself to my wrath, and do
not resist it!”

Thus they spoke; they then bound him firmly, and their work was
obviously done;

The hunter knew not what to do; he cried with pain and in despair
he let himself fall.

He could not even move, for the great ropes were very strong;

Sadly he wailed for his wife and children, but his voice was
muffled and unclear.

TRANSLATION 99

Canto 16.
1. “Oh my children, my wife, hear what I say! Dear one, see how
wretched I am!
No-one knows of my woeful state here in the sky, enduring the
greatest pain,
As legions of Kinkaras have roughly bound me, so that I could
not move;

It was, mark you, because of my sinfulness, they said, that they
so reviled my person.

“If my family are there, tell them to come and help me;

When you come to pay homage to the One who is causing me pain,
you must kneel down and ask for me back.

Try your hardest, my treasure, so that I may come back again
and enjoy all the delights of existence;

In the hope that He may have a grain of mercy, you must surely
come and constantly worship Him.

Canto 17.

1.

“Resign yourself, my body, for judging from your wretched state
you are obviously in great trouble!

There is none able to see to you any more —

What will be left of you presently ? Think of that!

“All you who are left behind at home, hear what I say!
So here in the sky what is left of me fades away —
There is no-one to whom I can cry out, all my family are far away.

“My body is just as the flower-stalk of an ivory coconut palm,
notched for tapping — look!

Beaten to pulp and tightly bound,

No doubt it will be tapped dry and finally die.

“The cry of the kalankyan calling in the heavens is like my crying
— listen!

Look for my tears in the rain from the clouds,

And hear my wails in the rumble of the thunder.

. “In bewilderment do I wail for you, wife, while I cry out to the sky.

There is no-one at all I can tell
Of the depth of my anguish, as Fate is utterly merciless.”

TRANSLATION 101

Canto 18.

1.

Thus he spoke, but was only bound all the more tightly, and was
taunted and roughly used;

It is the inborn nature of the hosts of Yama that they are none
of them subject to pity:

“Where are those relatives of yours? They ought to come to me
and constantly pay me homage!

But I will not allow you to escape from the ropes, for your ways
have been nothing but evil.”

Canto 19.

1.

To make a long story short, while the hunter was being tormented
by the hosts of Kinkaras,

There arrived all at once the hosts of Ganas, bringing with them
the celestial chariot.

They were planning to take the soul of Lubdhaka and carry it
away in that splendid vehicle;

Then they stopped in their tracks, when they saw that he was
bound and could not move.

. Then said Mahodara to all the hosts of Kinkaras:

“Oh multitude of Kinkaras, listen this instant to what I ask!

What is it that the hunter has done wrong, that you have seized
him and obviously bound him?

It is certainly not proper that through your doing punishment
should descend on Lubdhaka!

“In fact he is of outstanding merit because of his vow, and he is
unequalled in the whole world.

The reason why I have come is that I have been ordered by the
god Iswara to seek the soul of the hunter.

Furthermore the chariot Puspaka here will be his vehicle for
approaching the feet of the god Siwa;

Therefore I say, release him quickly from his mighty fetters!”

Thus spoke he who was called Mahodara; then said Pracanda in
answer :

“Fie! Fie! What you say of the merits of the soul of Lubdhaka
is completely untrue,

For I know his ways, and that he has never done good works,

So I will certainly not suffer him to escape from the Cow-Headed
Cauldron!”

This he promised and thereupon ordered his troops to put Lub-
dhaka in a cage.

“Bring him quickly to Yama’s dwelling, for it is his destiny to be
an inmate of hell.

Let him taste terrible sufferings, and let nothing stand in your
way when you cause him anguish;

There is no doubt that this is the fruit of his evil deeds, causing
constant unhappiness.”

10.

11.

TRANSLATION 103

Thus spoke the worthy Pracanda to his troops, and making ready
they advanced.

They were just about to seize the hunter and take him along on
their return to their homes,

When the troops of the god Sankara attempted to snatch him away
in a mass onslaught ;

Furious, they attacked impetuously with their splendid weapons,
with overwhelming ferocity and roaring in unison.

When the hunter was seized and carried off in the heavenly chariot
which went gliding away,

The hosts of Yama were enraged, and in an effort to recover him
they advanced.

With their lances and cleavers and clad in armour they came on,
all heavily armed,

Shouting in the vault of heaven, which was filled with the hosts
of Kinkaras.

Immediately all the troops of Kirnkaras joined battle en masse;

The enemies were attacked wholesale, overwhelmed and pursued
by those who were mighty lions in the strife.

They hurled discuses at each other and fearlessly fought back if
struck by a club;

Thud, thud, thud went the shields when struck by the staves,
splitting and smashed to splinters.

Thunderously the battle raged while Kinkara and Gana grappled
hand-to-hand,

And the army of the Ganas was destroyed under the onslaught,
many men were lost or wounded.

And so they advanced together in formation, and their advance
could not be stemmed;

The Kinkaras were now destroyed under a shower of arrows;
many died and they could not rally themselves.

At the time when Yama’s army was fleeing in fear without looking
back at the foe,

Then Ugrakarna advanced, attended by his muititudinous troops.

In front bells and gongs boomed and cymbals clashed fearfully;

The men were armed with lances and spears, others with staves
and with short daggers.

Ugrakarna came swiftly forward bearing his dagger, which was
very long,

Just like a wild lion enraged at seeing a mighty enemy.

He laid about himself and those struck sought in fear to flee, and
seeing him were seized with fright.

The necks of others were broken, slashed by the terrible dagger,
and many died.

TRANSLATION 105

12. All those who were overtaken were lost, as they were overwhel-
mingly attacked by the Kinkara cohorts;
The army broke into confusion and none sought to recover himself
when he saw the throngs of enemies.
They all abandoned their weapons and fled, seeking a refuge in
their fear;
Turbans and armour, rings and neck-bands of all kinds were left
behind on the field.
13. Then the worthy Ordhwakesa came forward together with Puspa-
danta to resume the fight,
Out of pity for their troops which were being completely cut to
pieces by the violent enemy.
All the mighty heroes flocked to attack the Kinkara hosts,
And the assaulting forces met like streams of lava colliding, for
neither would give way.
14. The clash of battle was in full swing as they pursued each other
in turn, all of them valiant on the field,
Running each other through, exchanging dagger thrusts and slaugh-
tering each other, while others who were hit lay groaning.
Gongs and kettledrums boomed, and the sound of cymbals was
mingled with the din of lusty war-cries;
Cling, clang, cling rang the daggers as they struck each other,
parrying, while others snapped in two.
15. When the divine Puspadanta moved forward and called on the men
to go in, urging them on,
The troops were furious and struggled at close quarters, answering
losses with losses.
The Kinkara army withdrew broken, as they were trampled and
blocked, chased and pursued;
In disorder they sought their leaders, trying to gather, but all then
retreated and fled.

Canto 20.
1. As soon as Ugrakarna saw that his army was being broken and
defeated by the Gana army,
He rushed headlong to the fore to resist the advance of Puspadanta,
for whom he aimed.
Then Puspadanta saw him, and, on his guard, he bent his bow;
Warding off Ugrakarna’s charge he quickly came and closed in on
him ferociously.
2. The divine hero Puspadanta grasped his terrible club and held it
ready in his hand;
He tried to strike Ugrakarna’s neck, but he parried and the blow
missed him as he dodged.
He promptly retaliated with his terrible, sharp dagger, and one
could see its bright glitter ;
He was just raising it when he was suddenly caught off guard;
his head was smashed and he fell.

TRANSLATION 107

3. At the death of Ugrakarna, lying there in the midst of the field,
All the troops of Yama's army looked on in confusion and fear at
their defeated general.
Overwhelmed by the arrows fired by the worthy Puspadanta
coming after them,
They died in thousands, and others were killed by the army of
Ganas, which routed the enemy in a wild assault.

4. More and more hard-pressed, exhausted and afraid the troops

which escaped death in the slaughter fled;

Then Antaka came and asked why they were running away in
defeat, without returning to the fray.

They answered and told the whole tale of the death of Ugrakarna,
and how he was overcome:

It was because of Puspadanta, the enemy hero in battle, that none
would dare to fight.

Canto 21.

1. Antaka then came forward, followed by his serried troops;
He grasped his club, great as a lontar palm, and hard as a thunder-
bolt.
The destruction of enemies was indeed its very nature,
And sharp spears stood fixed in the side.

2. Nila joined Antaka when he advanced,
And with Ghorawikrama they stormed overwhelmingly forward.
A glittering thunderbolt was his weapon, its lightnings flashing;
It was obvious the enemy would be annihilated by it.

3. Their men were countless — some bore discuses, others had
hammers ;
Yet others had swords, and some had lances as weapons —
Pikes, javelins, axes, arrows or spears —
In a seething mass, milling together, they marched thundrously
onward.

4. With yells of glee they fearlessly attacked the Gana multitude,
Furious over the death of the worthy Ugrakarma.
All those who had been battered swiftly returned to the fore,
Eager to take the lives of their great foes.

5. Before long the battle was resumed as before,
And javelins and arrows flew through the air in countless flights.
The number of dead went unheeded by the battling forces,
And corpses piled up like mountains, heaped higher and higher.

10.

11.

12.

TRANSLATION 109

The most prominent of the heroes clashed, and none of them would
yield ;

In vain they tried to fire arrows, and being so tightly packed it
was impossible to swing a punch.

Only daggers, lances and knives still served as weapons of assault,

And so the battle turned into a confused hand-to-hand struggle on
the field.

. After that had gone on some time all the Ganas were swept away ;

Their enemies destroyed them, tore them to pieces and cut them up.

Terrified and panic-stricken they retired and sought a place to
hide;

They headed for Puspadanta, while they were pursued and ham-
mered at.

When the enemy reached Puspadanta he was overwhelmed whole-
sale;

By surprise they came upon him and released at him arrows of
supernatural might.

Ghorawikrama, Antaka and Nila advanced,

And all rushed on the heroic Puspadanta.

. Under this massive attack he even so remained unperturbed,

And resolutely beckoned to his yielding troops who had fallen into
disorder:

“Hey! Hey! Come back all of you, what is the cause for fear?

Face up to your foes! When I'm dead will be time enough to
retreat.”

Thus he spoke, urging his men to come forward,

And all those who had fled came forward again as best they could.
Puspadanta now joined battle with the enemy

And showered the trio with arrows.

He directed his attack against Antaka, that steadfast hero;

They immediately came to blows and each struck the other with
clubs.

Then the worthy Nila swung his thunderbolt,

And struck at Puspadanta, who parried, quickly dodging.

He was just attempting to pass by the one who was named Nila,

When Ghorawikrama came in from the side;

A very sharp thunderbolt was his irresistible weapon,

But somehow it snapped, parried by the club and rendered power-
less.

TRANSLATION 111

13. At the breaking of his thunderbolt he was swiftly pursued and
attacked,
But Antaka suddenly fought back from the left;
He then pierced the throat of the divine Puspadanta,
Who was all but killed, and therefore withdrew.

Canto 22.

1. After Puspadanta had retired from the field,
And all his men were afraid and worn out,
They were sought out and attacked, and some were stabbed with
daggers,
And those who looked back were angrily assailed.
2. Others were hit and run through and were moaning;
Before they were finally dispatched their voices were hoarse and
weak ;
Then they died, no longer able to rise,
Trodden underfoot and trampled by the disordered army.

Canto 23.

1. Urdhwakesa was furious when he saw the army of heroes fleeing,

And quickly went to the attack, together with his partner Wira-
bhadra, renewing the fight.

Determinedly the one called Prakarsa advanced, together with
Renukarna;

Their flights of arrows filled the sky, which darkened as if a shower
of rain were falling.

2. Any of Yama’s troops who attempted to return was destroyed,
and many were killed by the arrows;

Nila, Antaka and Ghorawikrama advanced together to meet their
opponents’ attack.

Hence there arose a confused mélée as they tried to push each other
back and threw each other to the ground, so that many were
killed,

By the arrows, thunderbolts and swords; as they were mown down
their necks were completely severed.

3. The shouting of the heroes was like the roaring of lions, raging
as if the heavens would split;

The fluttering of the flags, together with the drums and the
cymbals, made a deafening noise.

Everything was arranged for the sacrifice on the battlefield, and
all the requirements for it were assembled there

By the heroes, and hence they were heedless of their lives in
seeking out the enemy.

TRANSLATION 113

. The fight presented a spectacle as in a painting, it seemed. No-one
cared about the dead.

Thump, thud, crunch went the sound of the clubs which broke
against each other — those who were killed were dashed to bits.

There were others who hacked wildly and were themselves used
as blocks for the heads, which were cleanly severed;

Crushed were the skulls which they threw, while they thrust at
each other with arms and legs.

. Javelins and discuses were hurled together and filled the air in
unbroken waves;

Not in vain did they come to earth, and unerringly struck the
valiant troops, of whom many died.

Then Wirabhadra came rolling forward, together with Prakarsa,
pressing onward;

Smashed and destroyed were those whom they overtook, cut to
bits by the arrows, broken and shattered.

. Rank upon rank the legions of Yama fled, abandoning their
weapons in the strife;

Fiercely assailed and chased they did not return, and battered
reached their refuge.

Having fallen they could not rise, bruised and trembling, exhausted
and worn out, stricken with panic;

Weaker and weaker, they were showered with arrows, so that he
who stayed behind was bound to die.

. When Nila saw how his men were yielding, shattered by the
enemy,

Intently preparing he took his weapons in his hand, and when he
was ready he advanced.

On none other than the hero Wirabhadra did he hold his eye fixed,
gazing at him;

But straightway his attack was intercepted and by way of counter-
attack he was warded off in a man-to-man fight.

. At the advance of the one named Nila with his army, incomparable
in the strife,

The hosts of Ganas, not realizing that they were being counter-
attacked, were assaulted and routed by surprise.

They were swiftly pressed and overwhelmed on the flanks, and
not knowing what to do, they fell back;

But they were surrounded and therefore cut off, and were all
cornered.

. Thus it came about that the army of the Ganas was crushed and
overthrown by the assault of their adversaries;

They were attacked, pursued, chased and laid about with clubs
and swords.

They suffered losses a thousand-fold, and died hit by discuses or
pierced by terrible spears;

Still others died trampled underfoot or stabbed with daggers, and
moaning they were finished off.

TRANSLATION 115

Canto 24.

1. The worthy Wirabhadra was driven back
By his illustrious opponent named Nila;
The club was already in his hand,
With which he hoped to strike Wirabhadra to good effect.

2. But just when he struck with the great club,
It was straightway parried with a sharp knife;
Both the splendid weapons snapped at once,
And they ended up locked together, punching each other in an
embrace.

3. While they were stabbing and cutting at each other,
Wirabhadra was hard pressed in the fight, and was driven back.
But Urdhawakesa saw how exhausted he was,
And came together with Prakarsa to his aid.

4. Then the divine Wirabhadra stood his ground,
And seized his keen lance which glittered brightly.
The worthy Nila knew not what to do;
He was about to yield, but then prepared himself anew.

S. Just as he was being forced to withdraw,
He was all at once pierced by a sharp arrow;
Without his seeing the arrow coming,
Unerringly it struck his breast and buried itself there.

Canto 25.

1. At the death of Nila the army withdrew and all of them fled;
Panic-stricken at seeing the strength of the enemy, they abandoned
their arms;
In dozens and in hundreds the dead piled up,
Attacked by the hosts of the Gana army, mighty heroes in battle.

2. When Antaka saw how his troops were yielding in tumultuous
flight,
The light in his eyes gleamed as he called up the hosts of Kirkaras:
“Come on, advance at once and help our harassed troops,
The worthy Nila has been overcome, mark you, so they have
told me.

TRANSLATION 117

. Therefore your enemies must be destroyed, every one of them —
do not be afraid,

Go and meet them and overwhelm them with splendid weapons
from right and from left;

Approach them from the rear, crush them and smash them, cut
them up with your arrows;

I will act as your companion when you go to meet the mighty
enemy.”

. Thus he spoke and then went forward, assaulting the enemy
fearlessly,

Followed by the threatening attack of his army which was ad-
vancing tempestuously.

It was then that the troops of Ganas were hard pressed, made
powerless by this counter-attack ;

They scattered, lying flattened all about, mown down by great
daggers.

. When Antaka saw the worthy Wirabhadra he became infuriated,

Embittered at the death of Nila inflicted by the attacking Ganas;

And therefore he took his dreadful spear,

And did not miss the mark, the breast of Wirabhadra, at which he
took his aim.

. Straightway flew the spear from the hand of Antaka;

A gust of wind raged over the battlefield, destroying the affrighted
foe,

As a result of the draught caused by the speed with which it flew
from his hand.

It descended to strike the breast of the worthy Wirabhadra, who
fell.

. But he was aided by the hosts of Ganas on the battlefield,

And finally arose and withdrew, disabled because of the pain.

Prakarsa went to meet Antaka, while the latter was still blazing
with warlike spirit;

They headed for each other and in their duel tried to trick each
other with their eyes.

. We pass over the time they faced and each tried to outmanoeuvre
the other;

Their armies attacked at once, meeting and coming to blows again.

In their struggle hero met hero, grappling together;

They had no inclination to give in, and pursued their victory in
the battle.

. Prakarsa bent his bow, and when it was fully rounded

He aimed at Antaka’s throat, and it alone,

But when he fired Antaka managed to turn and then it missed —

Prakarsa on his part dodged as Antaka aimed at his side with
a lance.

TRANSLATION 119

10. On his guard Prakarsa, skilled in action, went to meet him;
He drew his terrible bow and bent it round — the arrows soared
without a break.
They showered Antaka, who seemed to be shattered with fright,
And moreover Urdhwakesa and Renukarna came pushing forward.

Canto 26.

1. While he was thus being attacked and overwhelmed by a shower
of weapons,
Pracanda and Canda, Kila and Paramestimrtyu came to his aid.
They released their weapons all together, so that the sky was
filled with them;
The drums echoed loudly, and the gongs and cymbals made a
thundrous noise.
2. The fine army in front of them, thick as flying ants, attacked in
formation,
Some millions in number, and the field of battle swarmed with
them.
They made a crushing attack on the hosts of Ganas, who for fear
could not rally themselves;
Abandoning their leaders they ran for their lives in fright, trem-
bling as they looked back.
3. That was the time when the exhausted armies of Ganas were wiped
out;
They died by the thousand and by the hundred-thousand, over-
whelmed by the troops of Yama.
Some had open, bleeding wounds on their chest or arms which
were smashed,
And others had their lower legs cut off, slashed by a swordsman
and mown down.
4. This inspired fear among all the hosts of the Gana army;
At the mere sight of a hostile face they would run;
But they were followed and hunted down with splendid weapons,
pierced with lances, cut with swords and stabbed;
Some died trampled underfoot, so that the way was completely
blocked by them.
5. The generals of the Ganas, Renukarna and Ordhwakesa, fled,
And Prakarsa was left behind, exposed by the flight of the whole
Gana army.
He was harassed by the multitude of attacking enemies, who
stormed him in masses,
But he stood firm and had no fear for the attack of the enemy.

TRANSLATION 121

6. He drew the Fire-Arrow and its light flamed marvellously, blazing
upward;
This consumed the enemy, and any who came before him were
destroyed.
They straightway turned to ash, and all whom he encountered were
totally incinerated
By the fire which continually blazed and flared.
7. But Antaka was on the alert, amazed to see how his clamorous
troops were being burned;
He called for a splendid weapon, and then the arrow Water
Summoner came.
Rain came rushing down and put out the Fire Weapon completely :
When the fire was extinguished Antaka called, railing at him:
“Hey, where is your strength now, you who bear the name
Prakarsa? See here!
All that fire has been swept away, clearly made useless through
my doing.
Thus shall I repay you: Come, look at the mighty weapon which
lies in my hand!
It will take your life; accept your certain death!”
Thus he spoke and then struck with his Wind Weapon, a great
marvel,
And unerringly hit the breast of the divine Prakarsa, who was
caught unawares.
Antaka was delighted, and pointing at him said, ranting harshly:
“Aha, now let us see you face up to the power of someone like me.”

Canto 27.

1. At that point Prakarsa was aided by the heroes — the whole Gana
army attacked in formation;
Mahodara with Pingaliksa, as well as Somawarna and Ganaratha
too,
They were the leaders of the Ganas, very mighty in battle and the
capable core of the heroes;
Together they advanced, and the flash of the arrows which cease-
lessly left their bows was like lightning.
2. The heroic armies before them in countless numbers rolled onward
in closed formation;
Some approached from the rear and some from the flanks, thick
as flying ants and shouting lustily.
Clubs, lances and spears they carried in unbroken ranks;
The drums boomed and the flags were like lightning as their
pennants were whipped by the wind.

TRANSLATION 123

3. At the advance of all the Ganas, headed by the divine Pingaliksa

and his men,

With all those who were numbered among the inhabitants of Siwa’s
heaven accompanying him, none were left behind.

Once they closed to the attack none fell back; indeed they ignored
the dead as they returned to the fore,

And so the battle developed into a confused melée, and in return
for losses they would inflict losses on the enemy.

Canto 28.

1. Such was the way they warded each other off and tried to destroy
each other, and without any of them knowing fear they clashed
together.

Pingalaksa advanced in order to meet the attack of the numerous
hosts of Kinkaras.

All the champions of the Kinkara side went to meet the Ganas,
who were exceedingly valiant;

They cut at each other with swords and while standing face to face
they were cut and krissed, and their wounds gaped.

2. The scene of the battle then looked like the sea, as the heroic
warriors clashed together;

Like thunder was the rumble of cymbals resounding, and like
lightning were the numerous weapons in the sky.

As smoke rose the flags, and in their density looked like a spreading
field of cloud.

Loud roared the voices, and the shouting boomed like the crash
of the thunder of ships.

3. Soon the Kinkara party was worsted and crushed in the fight ; they
were so exhausted that they lost their heads.

It was then that the heroic Antaka advanced, and met the brave
Pingalaksa,

Together with Pracanda, to aid their fleeing warriors, vassals and
servants.

Like a stream of lava from the peak of a mountain, so their army
crashed sweepingly forward.

4. In their attack these two fired their splendid arrows together,
aiming at Pingaliksa,

But nothing struck him — he escaped them by agilely dodging,
nimble as he was.

He advanced while drawing his arrows which he released in great
numbers with an effective magical formula,

And at once he hit Pracanda, who was painfully struck by the shot,
which ripped off his left arm.

10.

TRANSLATION 125

. The hosts of Kirkaras arose in fury, and together they advanced

on Pingaliksa on the battlefield.

They fired a mass of Snake-Snare arrows which sped through the
air with licking and twisting flames,

Only to be broken by the Bird-King arrow with which the mighty
Pingalaksa answered their attack;

They were in vain, for they had no power; they were all broken
and smashed by the Bird-King arrow.

Kaila was exceedingly angry and raged at the loss of the Snake-
Snare arrows;

He swiftly attacked, and drew his arrow which bore the name
Mass-Power.

This roared through the air which was completely filled by it;
it looked like rain in the month of Magha,

But it was carried along by the rushing Wind-Arrow which swept
away the other — it was turned around and sent back.

It was as if the heavens were collapsing because of the chaotic
clash of battle which caused a state of turmoil ;

The divine hosts staggered and were aghast because of the collision
of the splendid arrows, and were utterly dazed.

The god Sakra was disturbed and somehow did not know what to
make of it, as if an enemy were coming;

Such was indeed the effect of the terrible shouting, which was
audible in the three worlds, arousing terror.

. Far from dying down the furious wind swept away the hosts of

Kinkaras, so that they were destroyed and carried off;

Discuses, thunderbolts and lances fell as well, destroying the
enemy and smashing him to pieces.

All the heroic lions among the soldiery rushed up when they saw
how exhausted and confused the enemy was;

The losses increased, the dead piled up, thrown into disorder and
destroyed by the splendid weapons.

Canda and Pracanda were the most prominent of those who were
grievously hit — their chests were split by a thunderbolt;

Others were crippled or had dislocated shoulders, while some had
their heads split and were in the last convulsions.

All the generals of the Kinkara armies were crushed or badly
wounded without exception;

They were so badly wounded that there were none still whole,
broken by the pounding arrows.

The armies of the Kinkaras were at their wits’ end because of the
unabating flood of weapons;

Kala and Antaka both withdrew, baffled and powerless.

They paid no heed to the code of battle, panic-stricken at the sight
of the defeated warriors;

This is why they withdrew and fled, seeking refuge at the feet of
Dharmaraja in his palace,

TRANSLATION 127

Conte 29.

When the troops of Yama fled defeated and sought their refuge
at the feet of Yamaidhipa,

All the troops of Ganas withdrew and ceased pursuing their enemies
in battle,

Happy and elated they swiftly returned together through the sky
with the soul of Lubdhaka;

There in the chariot in front it was accompanied by the Ganas,
victorious in the strife.

2. We need not describe them on their way; in due course they
together came to bring their homage at the feet of Jagatpati;

And Lubdhaka also quickly bowed before the Lord, and was greeted
with kind words:

“It is fortunate that you have come, my dear fellow, you who excel
in devotion to duty and are meritorious through the great
fidelity with which you fulfil vows,

Here! Here! Come close by me, I am so pleased that you have
come to me.

3. “That was the reason why I despatched the hosts of Ganas to
invite you to come to Siwa’s heaven.

I am exceedingly obliged to you that you have kept a vow of
supreme holiness without faltering.

So this is the reward which you shall now receive for carrying out
that excellent vow:

Of all the hosts of Ganas there is no-one who will excel you, who
have earned the highest respect.

4. “So come now, receive my mark of favour toward you without fail ;

Indeed, you shall receive the most noble form of all who inhabit
Siwa’s heaven, as well as a jewelled carriage.

Firstly the eight powers, to begin with the power of becoming as
small as an atom, will be granted you, as well as the three eyes;

All the kinds of worthy and fine attire which I have as my own
attire will be offered to you.

5. “Clearly there will be no distinction between your body and this
body of mine;

Whatever is charming here in Siwa’s heaven you will indeed be
able to enjoy, and no-one else.

For as long as the five great basic elements are taught in the three
worlds,

So long will you thus enjoy bliss in Siwa’s heaven.”

6. Such was the boon of the god ISwara while he was being paid
homage by him who was called Lubdhaka ;

He was exceedingly amazed by the most excellent gifts which were
granted by the god Iswara.

He was delighted that he had assumed a divine form and was no
different from the shape of the Teacher of the World;

Without any doubt the reason for this was the vow of the Night
of Siwa, and nothing else.

TRANSLATION 129

Canto 30.
1. Let us pass over what happened to him who had earned himself
marvellous boons at the feet of the Lord Sankara,
And let us return to the army of Yama, after they had arrived at
Yama’s dwelling.
They paid homage before Lord Dharma, and then wiped away the
sweat which was dripping from their chests,
And together they told how they had not succeeded in getting hold
of the arch-villain called Lubdhaka:
2. "See what we have to offer you — we are all ashamed in no small
measure,
That we were not able to carry out your order which descended
to us to seize the soul of Lubdhaka.
When we had taken and bound him very firmly, without his
offering any resistance,
We were about to bring him back with us — clearly with no other
intention but to lay him at your feet.
3. “But suddenly there came all the hosts of Ganas, and wrested him
away from us.
According to what they said at least, they had been instructed by
Pasupati to look for him.
First they announced that he was ordering us to free him,
But we all refused to do as they said, as we treasured in our hearts
all Your Majesty had said.
4. “Then all together they fell on us, all armed with excellent
wea ;
After they had found Lubdhaka he went to Siwa’s heaven, with
the wimana as his carriage.
We did our best to pursue him, because we wanted at all costs to
get hold of him when he was carried off by the hosts of Ganas,
But they attacked and beat us, so that we were none of us able
to get hold of him.
5. “We were afraid when we saw what they did, all their regiments
raging fearfully;
There were some with three heads, others with five; still others
had three eyes at that time,
There were some with four arms, with ten or a hundred hands,
each of them bearing a weapon ;
Innumerable, they filled the whole sky and there was no resisting
their fantastic onslaught.
6. “See how broken all the troops are, the few that have escaped
death on the battlefield ;
There is none whose body is whole — some have their head split
open, others their chest;
Still others are sore wounded, their chest run through, pitifully
trying to cover it with their hands;
What can Your Exalted Majesty now do for us in our miserable
state?”

TRANSLATION 131

7. This then was what the whole army said, and Yama was embar-
rassed as to the right course of action;
He said, while attempting to curb his inner fury, which showed
in his surly glance:
“Fie, why is it that Siwa’s troops interfere with a body which is
mine?
Great is the wickedness of the Ganas to bring you harm and cause
you pain.
8. “For it was the instruction of the god Isa that it would be my
function to consider all the deeds of the living;
The good and bad conduct of the created I was to know, such was
his commission to me.
Those of good conduct, who obey the moral law, they would go
to the dwelling of Siwa,
But if they were evil and very wicked they would come to me in
order to serve as filling for hell.
9. “Now as for his perfidious altering of our work by taking
Lubdhaka,
What will now be our work, if we are dismissed from the duties
which were laid upon us by Iswara?
All these captives, what is the point of our continuing to keep
them here for nothing?
I shall resign my work of observing the distinction between good
and evil in accordance with the direction of Ganadhipa.
10. “But you too think about it, for perhaps we have forgotten some-
thing in the conduct of the one called Lubdhaka;
Perhaps he has indeed carried out a vow which results in his not
being punished.
The worthy Citragupta, him we ask what his merit in the past
has been

Look into it carefully in your galih, read it and check whether
I have perhaps been negligent.”
11. Thus he spoke to Citragupta, who then began looking in his galih
straight away,
While he checked right through it, pointing with his finger and
turning it back and forth.
But there was not the slightest trace of merit mentioned in the
galih, thus he respectfully informed king Yama,
And that was why the latter betook himself to the dwelling of
Girisa to resign his function,
Canto 31.
1. After the departure of the god Dharmapati from his kingdom he
sped onward,
With all his senior servants accompanying him,
Without erring from his course he went straight to the dwelling
of Sambhuy,
And his servants travelled with him through the sky, rushing
onward.

TRANSLATION 133

2. We need not tell about his journey; he made quick progress and
did not delay;
He then came to the dwelling of Rudra, a splendid, high mountain
Called Kailasa, very wonderful and of incomparable beauty ;
Heaven was clearly no match for its design, which aroused pas-
sionate feelings.

3. On the peak of Kailasa lay the dwelling of the god Pasupati;
There were priceless jewels of which all the buildings were made,
Filled with brahmans and sages as well as troops of celestials;
All were paying their homage before the god Trinayana, praising

him with Vedas.

4. The Lord and his spouse were seated on the golden throne,

With the heavenly women, who sat behind the daughter of
$ailendra ;

Their beauty was like that of the goddess Ratih who had taken
the form of the heavenly women,

Out of joy at seeing the splendours of Rudra’s abode.

Canto 32.

1. The immortal women who were all paying their respects before
them were each of them beautiful in their own right;
There were some who all at once set about repairing their coiffure
and were combing it with their sharp nails;
The charm of their glance when they looked seemed to be like
tears, because of the smarting of the kohl ;
Their countenances looked like the moon covered by a cloud because
of their dusting of powder.
2. There was one beautiful woman, whose form was as in a painting,
and who seemed to be weighed down by people's gaze;
Her hair was disturbed and fell charmingly over her face, as she
tried to fold her kain which had come loose.
The slim line of her waist seemed about to snap under the heavy
burden of her breasts,
And she was very languid as she walked, with a coquettish gait,
as if she were not able to take one step ahead.
3. Indeed if her beauty should have to be described, it was like a sea
of honey which rippled with her glances;
The line of her eyebrows was beautiful and sharp as a reef, being
untouched by powder,
And its waves were the disordered tresses tumbling over her cheeks
and carelessly reaching as far as her shoulders;
It was only natural that such beauty should wreck the passion of
one who sought her charms in the bed-chamber.

TRANSLATION 135

4. There was one like a sister of the gentle rumble of the thunder at
the coming of the fourth month —

Doubtless the joy of the onlooker would bud forth when he should
see her waist as it was exposed,

And the love of him who might try to lay bare her virginity on
the couch would turn to a gentle rain;

The longing of him who strove to entwine himself with her in
union would bear tendrils of passion.

5. Others were splendidly clothed and adorned, all paying their
homage before the god Iswara;

They sat in rows, and in their youthful charm they looked like
a mass of flowers.

Sweet were their glances as they spoke, hesitantly and slowly and
deliberately withholding a giggle;

They were so beautiful that they looked like an incarnation of the
goddess of the beauty of the fourth month,

6. But no matter how beautiful they thus were, they could even so
not equal the beauty of Maheswari;

Her charms seemed as if they would dissolve into a flower when
one looked at them.

Honoured by all the beauties of shore and mountain her whole
bearing aroused delight,

And he who might try to describe her sweetness was at his wits’
end, for she was in truth the deity of love.

7. It would take too long if all the charms of her bearing were
described, while she was granting audience to the heavenly
nymphs ;

Meanwhile king Yama had arrived with his troops and had entered
the audience court.

Then he hurried in, bowing respectfully, and devotedly wiped the
feet of I5wara,

And his praises were very brilliant and most distinct for Jagatpati
to hear.

Canto 33.

1. “Hail! Behold the homage of him who has no refuge, here at the

lotus-feet of the Lord of the World;

Outwardly and inwardly I pay homage to you, who are the
constant object of my devotion.

Visible and invisible are you in the whole world, you are the life
of the living, and bring about both good and evil;

You are the permanent object of desire of those who purify the
spirit by abandoning the ten senses.

TRANSLATION 137

2. “In consecration and other rites you represent the state of complete
abstraction, you are the consummation of what has gone
before — you par excellence and none other.

In the sacred books you are the embodiment of the holy syllable,
and nothing else will ever exceed you;

You are corporeal and incorporeal, subtler than the slendrest body,
and coarser than the greatest;

You are present in the stationary and the moving; you alone are
the goal of him who takes refuge in the Void.”

Canto 34.

1. Such was the essence of the praise which he uttered at the feet of
the lord Sankara;
Then he was answered by Trinagarantaka with words which were
kind and winning:
“My dear fellow, I know of your intention in coming to me, and
have comprehended it —
Forgive what I have done, and do not misunderstand it, my son.
2. “I ask you expressly, old chap — one thing only is what I wish:
That man named Lubdhaka, do not persist in taking him away,
For he satisfies the highest moral law, and he has the great merit
of good deeds, through his having fulfilled an excellent vow.
That is why 1 did my best to take him by sending out the hosts
of Ganas.
3. “Listen to what I have to say, why a man of such low birth as this
Sabara has succeeded in reaching Siwa's heaven:
Formerly, in the primeval age, I taught the famous penance of
the Night of Siwa,
But no-one has ever carried it out since the time I did that,
And in the course of time I myself forgot that I had taught the
vow — so it goes if there is no-one who practises it.
4. “However, that vow which I had taught was so excellent that it
certainly bears most worthy fruit:
Not only does it eliminate all evil deeds, but it gives especial
pleasure and good fortune as well.
One will definitely not go to the realm of Yama -— that is the
reward for a man who carries out that vow.
All his sins are destroyed by the fruit of the vow of which I have
spoken, without fail.
“Now, the fellow named Lubdhaka alone has carried out this
excellent vow ;
He stayed awake during the night in the dark half of the seventh
month, on the superb fourteenth day.
To be sure, he did not mean to carry out that superior vow — the
reason why he did not shut his eyes was his fear;
But even so he reaps the fruit of it, and that indeed is the reason
why he has come to Siwa's heaven.

TRANSLATION 139

6. “You must therefore obey me, my good man; do not fail to heed
what I have said.
Come, you return to your own kingdom and persevere in all the
work you did of old.
All the dead I shall revive, all those who fell in battle,
For their aim was right, and they stuck loyally to the instructions
of their lord.”
7. Thus spoke Trinagarantaka as he despatched homeward Yamapati,
who was devoted and submissive;
“Your servant makes bold to ask, how could he ever refuse anything
that Jagatpati has decreed?
Forgive me what I did; that it may not arouse your anger, this is
what I ask, and nothing else.
For the conduct of Your Majesty’s servant was indeed very wrong
that he caused the soul of Lubdhaka suffering.”
Canto 35.
1. Many were Yama’s words with which he expressed his submission
to the God of the Ganas,
And Siwa was pleased to hear all that Yama said, moving his heart.
Then he set out, after he had wiped the feet of the divine Trinaga-
rantaka in farewell.
He was perplexed to see how a Sabara had become the equal of
the hosts of gods.
2. Let us not describe him as he passed on his way through the sky
and came quickly to his kingdom.
Already all the dead had each one come to life again through the
power of Siwa;
They were not yet altogether conscious, and imagined that they
were lying in bed at home with their loved ones;
Absently they rolled up the trousers of those who had just come
to, but were surprised to see they had the wrong one.
3. It would be too much to relate what they did, but they all laughed
a lot together;
They returned and on arriving home their loved ones came to
meet them, full of longing.
They told how the war had gone, and displayed all the wounds
with which their chests were covered.
This rent their loved ones’ hearts so that they embraced them,
their words coming to life as they spoke.
Canto 36.
1. We need not relate how they came together and fulfilled all the
longings of lovers;
Rather let us speak of the daughter of Girindra, who was very
joyful to hear what Trinayana said.
She then enquired about the rules of the vow which is called the
Night of Siwa, and asked to be told,
What one must do if one should want to carry out the vow, and
what the rites are which one must perform.

TRANSLATION 141

2. “I who constantly live on your favour ask this simply to make my
submission complete;
Tell me in full what one has to do in order to fulfil the vow, for
it is my wish to do so.
For this is what you said: ‘Even if the vow is not intended, verily
its fruit
Will be reaped by him who watches in the month of Magha, on the
fourteenth night of the dark half of the month.” ”
3. “Little sister, how delighted I am, my treasure, to hear your
question to me;
I shall tell you, my dear, the rules of the excellent vow — listen
well to what its fruit is, my treasure,
And above all what the marks are of one who executes it, so you
should pay good attention to what I say;
Through it a man may reach Rudra’s heaven and escape hell, to
his eternal blessing.

Canto 37.
1. “In the morning, after applying the mind to concentration on the
deity, you must come to the house of your teacher;
You should then make an obeisance and ask his leave to carry out
the vow, placing the foot of the teacher on your head.
After that you must bathe, blacken your teeth and then perform
the worship of Siwa’s fire;
This must be accompanied by fasting and silence, and you must
put on a new, clean jacket.
2. “After the day is done you must stay up without fail during the
night and not go to sleep;
The holy lingga of the lord Siwa alone must be worshipped in the
world of the gods,
Kumdira and Gajendrawadana must be honoured first.
During the night the four watches must be observed in proper
order, giving the ritual its full weight.
3. “Jasmin,oleander, gambir arja, kecubun with white waduri and putat,
Asoka and ndgapuspa, moreover tanguli, bakule and kalak with
campaka;
Blue, red and white lotuses, in fact all the flowers that there are
you must then take —
First and foremost the tender shoots of the maja and sulasih should
be the floral offerings of one who worships Him.
4. “And all sorts of fragrant things must be used as incense, with
ghee and holy lamps in the night,
And as offerings milk porridge and molasses porridge, mixed with
green peas.
All this must serve as the primary offering, though you must also
accompany it with fruits, drinks and meats.
These, then, are the rules which you must observe for the whole
night, watch by watch, without omitting anything.

10.

TRANSLATION 143

“Drums and all kinds of other musical instruments played together
should be used as a means for keeping sleep from the eyes —

Even reciting a kidun or absorbing yourself in a kakewin, per-
forming arja or gambling,

But it is most beneficial if you can then tell the tale of the Sabara,

For it is plain that he who relates the story of the soul of Lubdhaka
will reach the highest heaven.

“When night disperses and day comes give presents at the court;

A golden lingga of Siwa should be your gift to the great brahmans,
who are supremely virtuous and expert in the Vedas.

No matter who should happen by, you must give him presents
according to your ability — do not refuse them!

Furthermore safeguard yourself from sleep during the day as well,
and do not be thoughtless in anything that you do.

“After you have successfully carried out the vow as I have
described,
All the fruits of sacrificing, doing asceticism or charitable deeds,
as well as bathing in holy pools, will be inferior to this.
Even though one may have enjoyed a thousand million sinful deeds
in one’s previous existence,

These will nonetheless be wiped away through the performance
of the worthy vow of the eminent Night of Siwa.

“No matter how a man has wrought evil and grieved his fellow-
man —

Whether he has been a murderer of brahmans, or has returned
evil for good, if he has violated his teacher's bed, or has killed
a child in the womb —

All his sins are undone if he keeps a vigil when it happens to be
the excellent Night of Siwa,

Because of the supreme power of this vow — such is the meaning
of what I said.

“Even if he does not carry out the vow, but remains conscious
and simply does not fall asleep at that time,

No matter what sort of person he may be, old or young, woman,
man or girl,

He will surely reach the heaven of Siwa and taste happiness, and
never have troubles again;

Whatever he desires will surely be fulfilled and he will reap the
fruits of the good he has done.”

Such were the words of the god ISwara, and all the gods were
perplexed when they heard them.

The daughter of Girindra responded, bowing low and giving ear
to all the instruction of Jagatpati.

We pass over how they parted at the approach of night, after he
had given his directions;

This was the time when the hosts of gods went to carry out the
vow, even unto the ends of the universe.

TRANSLATION 145

Canto 38.

1. Such is the close of this tale called The Observance of the Night
of Siwa, the blessed,
Though in poesy it falls far short, and offends against metrical
rules.
It is the work of a poet not accomplished in poetic arts, who bears
the name of Tanakun.
In confusion he seeks a means of stilling his perplexity of spirit,
and is unendingly miserable.
2. The reason why he attempts to concentrate his mind, in order to
force out poetry in the form of the kakawin,
Is not that he is such an expert in evoking emotions, as he struggles
to arrange his words.
It is quite obvious that he will not find favour in the eyes of other
people,
But released from earthly impurities, may this poem still be a means
for him to return to the Absolute,

Canto 39.

1. It is as if I am sick, having been left so long, cut off from the

beauties of nature, and I have become completely dismal.

If I only think how wonderful it is to wander about composing,
it makes me quite distressed of spirit;

There would be no comfort for my confusion, and the darkness
of my mind is so deep as to lead to torment,

If I did not take my refuge in beauty as a means of soothing cares,
in the manner of one who occupies himself with poetry.
