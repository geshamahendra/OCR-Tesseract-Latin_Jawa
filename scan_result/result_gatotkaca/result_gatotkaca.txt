CANTO1

1 One only is the origin of the essence of beauty, which is sought in

medjtation and is truly difficult to find:

It spreads roundabout and pervades every corner of the world in a
subte form, and is d:scerned when the mind is in a state of trance;

Corstantly it is given form on the poet's writing tablet, is composed as
songs of praise in the form of kakawin, and takes visible shape as the
letters, :

The ready vehicle of master poets when they set their hearts on release
from the world through the mysteries of the muse.

2 Itoojoin in the practice and strive to wield the pen with a poem as my

exercise -

It is a work of the intellect, but I just do my best to seek out the secret
nuances of poetic sentiment.

Such is the reason for me to make bold to weave together the tale of
Arjuna’s son -

Even if it should be scorned, then so be it: its aim is to be a means of
carrying me safely home to Smara’s abcde.

.3 His Majesty King Jayākṛta, that distinguished king, is in very truth Lord

Keśawa:

It is well kmown that he was once Kṛṣṇa, and has again taken on human
form to serve as an able guardian of men,

As he was distressed that the world was being destroyed and the
Creator's work would come to nought -

For when the god Rudra annihilates it, how could it not be swept clean
away, if he did not take pity on i?

Translation, Canto 1 2

The proof of this was that the troublemakers were brawling and
stabbing at each other, vying in deeds of villainy,

And such is the reason that Lord Wiṣṇu arose as a king to root out the
evildoers.

His meritorious acts as Mapañji Madaharṣa are sure, restoring the world
to a state of prosperity:

Sacrifices and works of charity, gifts and the scriptures are given pride
of place once more, and the Holy Lore awakes.

Moreover, his teacher is the same is the sage Wṛhaspati, an expert and
learned in the scriptures, l
Deeply spiritual, beyond the grasp of the senses, a seer, incomparable in
good gualities, utterly learned and eminent in political wisdom.

This is the reason that the world is submissive and devoted to the king,
and his enemies have fled in disorder and disappeared,

For the royal might is like fire fanned by the wind in the presence of this
prince of sages.

There is nothing that might trouble His Majesty’s mind, now that his
foes have been swept away,

And at his ease he devotes himself to the arts, to the joy of the poets
whom he joins in composing poetry.

He is pressing and urging me to undertake it, and this is why I am
composing the tale of Arjuna’s son -

But it is the illustrious Kṛṣṇa who should be followed in the story, as his
actions are comparable to the king|s, as its most eminent patron.

CANTO2

1 In former times when Yudhiṣthira lost at dice and staked his kingdom

and crown,

They were seized by the Korawa king, down to the last of his fine
clothes.

So this is why the five Pāṇḍawas departed for the depths of the forest,

And would wait there for twelve years - that was the appointed time
before they would again enjoy life in the palace.

We need not tell what befell them in their forest hermitage, but offer a
branch of the tale for your ears:

There was a son of Dhanañjaya, suitably young, strong and heroir,

Knowledgeable and blameless, who went by the name of the excellent
Abhimanyu among people far and wide -

It was as if the God of Love had assumed his body, desiring to be taken
as a model for an incomparable appearance.

While he was still with his father, the extent of his happiness had been
limitless:

He enjoyed an unegualled abundance of pleasurcs, and his heart's desire
was there for the taking.

But now that Arjuna had left him, he was withdrawn and lustreless,
always behaving pitifully -

As a result of having resigned their bwn country, he simply had to take
refuge in the palace of another.

8 The place was called Dwārawatī, indeed a very heaven come down to

earth,

For the king was in truth Wiṣṇu, known as the illustrious Kṛṣṇa in the
mouths of men.

Further, it was arranged as two, as there was also his elder brother, one
with him in fearsome might,

Known ss the illustrious Baladewa; their two courts lay side by side,
equally fine.

| 9 This, then, was where the excellent Abhimanyu served humbly at the
feet of the divine king Kṛṣṇa;
The reason that he was kindly disposed was that, as a nephew, he was as
if none other than his own son,
For his mother was the renowned Subhadrā, a younger sister to the king,
So this was the family bond that he followed in coming to pay his
respects and taking refuge there in the role of a servant.

10 Yet even though he was allowed to have his own uarters, and was

! tended fondly by his mother and the corps of pages,

l  Not to mention the soldiery, who watched over him in every proper
way,

In the manrer of the other royal princes, as Kṛṣṇa had decreed, without
distinction,

He was still not at his ease, as like a herald he had to be in constant
attendance at court.

ś11 lInshort, he had reached the age of twelve years, and then was just

turning into a young man.

The signs of amorous thoughts resided in his eyes, and these lent
sweetness to his glances.

How could the hint of charm in his speech not turn to feelings of love,
redolent of the bedroom?

And how could the rapture of the heart not fail to bring forth a pretty
song?

Willing to come and steal a look at him, approaching his sleeping-place.

And this is why they would whet the line of their sharp teeth, already
freshly tempered,

As a means of renewing the assault on his broad, handsome chest, so
that it could be stabbed by their breasts and touch his heart.

CANTO3

It would take too long to tell of the heartache of the women who longed
for him, each affected by her own kind of attachment.

His service to King Harimûrti was deeply pleasing, affecting the core of
his heart;

For this reason he never tired of studying the texts, and their power was
appropriated through the natural leaning of his mind -

He was awaiting one final lesson, as the highest of royal favours was not
yet complete.

Moreover the king had a mind to make him his son-in-law, but kept this
hidden in his heart.

What he feared was the generally accepted custom, so this is why he was
not willing to decree it.

However, if they should come together without being told to, and he
should end up buying her with a deed of heroism,

Then ‘Would that not be best?* he thought, as he understood the charm
of using force to win love.

Now the beauty of the princess was beyond imagining and could not be
depicted,

Or perhaps the last resources of the gods for creating a lovely woman
had been used up.

Out of fear of failure they went ahead and practised by making
Tilottamā:

If this should be battered, then finally they would be reluctant to go on -
how could there possibly be another?

Text, Canto3 Translation, Canto 3 ṇ

The beauties uf the garden were troubled by her charms when she had
adorned her uncovered body:

The fiowers cf the mangunĕng fell in worry and embarrassment, afraid
they might be used to add to the fragrance of her hair;

The leaves of the imba could be seen frowning, concerned that her
eyebrows might want to attack them,

And even the lotus wilted, thinking it might be driven mad by looking at
her eyes.

How could the shoots of the kayu manis tree make the least impression
on her lips as she looked coyly away when offered homage?

The resolve of the bees was to fly away, fearful of the flash of her teeth
when shown in a smile;

The nuts of the ivory betel-palm were too contused to look around at her
breasts when claimed as kangsi gongs for playing the music of love,

After the failure of the tender shoots to bear fruit, constantly swaying
languidly in attendance on her slender waist.

And the pliant tendrils of the gaḍung vine were far from being able to
entwine the arms of the princess,

Viewing the buds of the wakung turning pale when humbly coming into
the presence of her fingers, although they never touched.

Even the fragrant pandanus-buds waiting respectfully knew they should
be apprehensive and were hesitant to be brought into contact with her
calves -

For it was the nature of her beauty to,be noble, passionate and proud to

be superior in loveliness.

It would be too much to describe in full her appearance, for in truth she
excelled Ratih, the Grddess of Love.

She was knuwn by the name princess Kṣiti Sundarī, with good reason
held in high regard in the palace.

She was of course stirred by various emotions, and conceived a desire to
go roaming, happy and carefree:

Her idea was to make a tour through the scenes of nature, led on by the
gaḍung tendrils pointing the way.

Moreover the month of Kārttika was summoning up its beauties, eager
to devote itself to the muse:

Elated, the soft thunder kept calling constanty as a signal to the clouds
being blown along by the wind,

The flash of the lightning was guite moving as it gave a wink to fix a
time for leaving on a trip into the countryside,

And all night long the rolls of the thunder urged, as it whispered about
how lovely it would be to go on a journey.

It seemed that the charms of the wooded mountains were eager to vie
with her beauty when she came to revel there:

Already their slopes were gleaming with a creamy campaka complexion,
rubbed on by the heavy rain;

Their hair of dark clouds was nicely arranged, and their hair-band was
the rainbow;

The white herons flying in neat formation in and out of the cloud - how
could they be inferior to jasmine flowers?

Playfully the mountains wore shoots as aigrettes, with the howers of the
asana as make-up and the thin mist as rice-powder.

The humming of the bees surrounḍing the owrers was their enchanting
flower-ornament, putting wwungu blooms in thcir hair,

And furthermore they wore as sale-sale the wĕlus-ary creeper, cunningly
matching with their cords of gaḍung vine.

Such was the beauty of the scenes as related by the rolling thunder.

[t enraptured the young lady who was day-dreaming, still absorbed in
gazing skyward.

Then she spoke carelessly, while absently leaning and resting on the arm
of her lady-in-waiting,

And the rainclouds seemed to be watchśul to silence the thunder while
waiting upon her sweet words:

‘I wonder how it will be when l go on my wanderings, ladies. I could
roam enchanted and lead the life of an anchoress:

My head-band will be the aśoka and trñjung twined and hemmed, and
my bahiri will be of branches.

Let my ash-mark be the pollen of the fragrant pandanus, and let me
wear as a sash youny shoots threaded on a gaḍurg vine;

With peace of mind I shall withdraw to the hills and shores, taking as
provision only the fresh, sweet vegetables of the Fourth Month.

Translation, Canto 4 ś47

It will not take very much to make us a tasty meal as we go together
searching for young lĕmpuyang leaves;

Contentedly we shall gather mushrooms and vegetables, and we shall
catch grasshoppers untroubled by the chilly rain.

Tendrils and flying ants will be what we get to make a soup on the
banks of the river,

Ard es for food and a little rice, the thing to do would be to cook them
in tubes of bamboo.

This is what the princess said, trying to interest her nurses and ladies,
who were straight away overjoyed:

'Oh what you say is wonderful, madam, that we should go and enjoy
roaming the woods!

Indeed, even though many are the highest pleasures to be enjoyed by
those who stay hidden within the palace walls,

Somehow one becomes surfeited and weary if they are not relieved by
relaxing on a pleasant trip.

In short, my lady, it would be best to persuade the King - have no
doubts about it.

And your mother can be relied on to support it - why should she refuse?
It is obvious she will be pleased.

For the Queen has always been a lover of beauty, she who has the name
of Rukmiṛṛ;

Observe it, madam, in the longing for beauty which you have inherited
through the names of your father and mother.

CANTO 5

Thus they spoke, and so fñrstly they went to the Queen

E  And told her of the princess's request to go and enjoy herself on a

journey.

ī The Queen then informed the King, and he had no objection:
ñī They would waittill tke moon was almost full - on the twelfth they

would set out.

After the plan was agreed all the people of the interior were given gifts:

For the maid-servants a share to the value of one paha each, and for the
widows, wet-nurses and the aunts to the value of half of this;

The King's women were given no occasion to be envious, as they all got
just a little from the treasurer,

Or else those who went without payments for new clothes, held back
due to debt, just grumbled to themselves.

Although there would be no problem with the financial means, for the
King had an abundance,

Even so they were embarrassed and bewildered at always having to
return the presents he gave;

y Especially those who had been favoured with his love were worried

about the displeasure the envious might show,
But if they should keep silent at their annoyance, might they not fear he
would give them nothing?

Translation, Canto 5 51

There were also serving-girls who went and asked for a contribution
from their mothers, elder and younger sisters and friends outside the
palace,

And to their sweethearts they sent messages giving money to get clothes
fine enough;

betting on the cockfights -

. lt was these whose eyes were fillea with tears as they tried not to cry, for

they were distressed and frightered they would be found out.

ĕ And the guardsmen were allotted presents, for as far as they were given

duties escorting the party,

k And the princes of the Yadus, Sāmba and Gada, who were instructed to

stand by.

The excellent Abhimanyu and in particular his mother were on the alert
and had already made their plans,

Because they were embarrassed about getting too far into debt, and
counting on gifts would be shameful.

When the appointed time to set out had arrived, later that night at the
sixth hour (3 am.),

The elephants, chariots and horses were on hand and the sedan-chairs
were standing ready, and so the night sped by.

The people of the interior sat up by lamp-light all night long, to put on
eye-shadow, dress and arrange their hair

Some shrieked when jabbed with an eye-shadow stick as someone
jostled their arm while they were applying it.

Translation, Canto 5 sṣ

Let us tell of the princess's appearance when she had finished putting on
her adornments and fiowers:

Her dress was of raṇḍi silk coloured with gold dust, glowing and
glittering beautifully.

Her shawl was of Chauli cloth indistinguishable from vapour and as
solid as the spreading mist -

How could an admirer afford to blink when looking at her, for he
supposed that she might fade away and disappear.

But who of course would dare to look at her, unless he insisted on
bringing a curse upon himself?

Further, her beauty was being guarded and even her adornments were
always out of bounds.

Just look at the wirḍga creeper entwining her coiffure and the aigrettes
bearing the standard of the asanu,

And the flowers in her hair drawn up and competing to watch over the
arrangement of her hair-band.

Plainly it was the coals of the God of Love that had been made into her

noble suwêng on her forehead,

And formed as a maṇḍagu, shaped as a means of hiding the scent of her

perfumed cheeks.

R The red paint on her lips caused a fine, fragrant scorching for scaring oft

the thieves of love,

Rī And the smarting of the kohl in her eyes undoubtedly made them
\ sweeter, till somehow they could not be looked at.

śô The assembled jewels of her ‘ear-cups' were attentively lighting up her

ears,

k: While her necklaces were arranged across the middle of her breasts, and

would allow no one to kiss them.

ḍĕ. The wristlets varied in the ways they entwined her arms, calmly and

always as pitiful as the wĕlas-arêp vine,

 Aṇd her rings felt faint and exhausted by her sweetness as they tried to

. resist the kneading of her fingers.

j She was not distracted, however, by the large number of plates in the

gold of her girdle,

And likewise the band: of her calves seemed to be teasing each other as
they reported back and forth.

Such was the extent of the watch her ornaments kept over her beauties
lest they be seen,

But if a lover should insist on being stricken with passion, he would
certainly die on the spot with infatuation.

Then the sixth hour struck, and that was when the King and the inmates
of the palace emerged,

All of them with their own carriages, right down to the ladies-in-
waiting.

Those who had been allotted places were elated, but the ones who had
not yet mounted wept and wailed;

Left behind they constantly fluttered back and forth, restless and
downhearted, fearful they might have to go on foot.

ose who had arrived within the palace were troubled and exhausted,
nd wearily were greeted in the ways natural for ones who have just

ḍ  come.

Pĕecause of their tiredness they seemed to be lifeless,

And then went to sleep, so deep that they forgot about sheets.

k This is why Sudarpaṇa tried to soothe her feelings of dejection.

. While distracting herself by singing snatches of sweet songs,

"Or else of her longing to be a hermit and die in the mountain forests far
away,

p Because she was tired of not having success in offering her services or

î receiving avour.

f Now when the princess heard this she felt deeply pained,

p And moreover was not yet asleep, restlessly sighing and tossing to and
f So it was that she went out in order to join her, weak and trembling,

ś As if in a trance she trailed her bed-sheet, and her hair was loose and
unkempt.

ś lShe moved as if counting her footsteps, like a languid tendril,

kb And feeling weak she chewed betel, absently gazing into the far sky.

î !Coming there, she sat on her lap, sṇoke kindly and passed her a betel-
ĕ quid,

# And on the pretext of being chilled she desired to put her head on her

ś lap.

ś| Straight away Sudarpaṇā welcomed her with soothing words and tried
Ri to console her:

‘Oh my dear, how lucky it is! You are my treasure, my lady.

ê' Come, what kind of sadness of yours is this>Or what can be done to
cure it?

HMy life, my dear little sister, will be the means of making you well.

19 elder sister, I do not know what would be best, nothing is any good.
îpe root of my malady is that l am sickened by the scent of sweet

k îowers,

p well as the rumble of the thunder and roar of the dreadful breakers,
ñ* } ese make me keep hearing things in my mind, without any soothing

Bĕ Oh, my dear, this is serious! It is not ‘beach-sickness’ that you have, in
î my opinion.

ĕyour illness is what is called ‘cousin-disease’ - an exceptional case.

d e only medicine for it is to take a cosmetic oil from a cousin - that

ê would make it better.

! ou would without doubt be cured, my dear, by being consoled and

* given a betel-uid.

ī ṣ low in my opinion the betel-uid of Abhimanyu would be effective -
[ĕMoreover he is your first cousin, so he is suitable to be your man.

êsut this would not work if it were revealed while you are in seclusion by
ṭ order of your parents,

RAnd so this has to be done secretly, under cover of night, later on.

is is what Sudarpaṇa said, but the young lady did not reply, feigning
sleep,
īle she nudged her with her nails and tried to wake her, but she took
J' no notice.

śFinally she stood up in deep thought and called her

go up into the house and sleep, and then led her tenderly up.

en they reached her bed Sudarpaṇa lulled her to sleep and covered
ḍ her with ablanket.
Jâs soon as she had closed her eyes she went to sleep as a result of her
īḍöt of course she dreamed it was Phalguṇasuta fondly kissing her,

ṭ îll suddenly she was awakened by the birds making an excited clamour

śAs for the difficulty of entering the palace, though,

"What is the problem if something is done secretly and with careful
planning?

lAny problem in what you undertake can be overcome -
ḍPersistence is the unly means for doing it.

ṭ

i
,However, if later on there is of course an obstacle,

lsuch will be the time to seek death by waging war.

ṭDeath will be pleasant if it is a refuge and support in what you do,
J:And then the princess will certainly join you by stabbing herself
ś
ṭThese were the words spoken by the one called Sudarpaṇa,

ś And immediately Arjunātmaja felt moved,

âAt the depth of his longing, which could not be escaped.
And this is why he resigned himself, and would risk his life.

f: Moreover the king had of course often said
śThat he praised the hero who is so in love that he seizes his beloved by
. force.

For these reasons he accepted Sudarpaṇâ's advice,

PAnd was determined not to be untrue to his word.

ĕIt was agreed that the third day of the waning moon

hWould be the favourable ‘time and place* for them to look for.

J Translation, Canto 21 131
When they had settled the agreement to this effect,
Sudarpana took leave to go back inio the palace.

f You were like a visible form of the deity of the unearthly beauties of the

sea-shore when you were seeking enchantment there,

So that is why l prayed to the gods and practised the samadhi of amorous

longing in order to be favoured with your kindness.

j But now that you have granted it, so that l shall be capable of

combatting the power of love,

f Where is there a passion that will dare to look upon my kakawin, now

that I have been accepted as a poet world-conḍuering in beauty?

So let me beg you, lady, not to retumn into the honeyed words that you
wrote on the pandanus bud;

Think of the confusion of the heartache right on the spot when pained by

longing at a false smile.

j lEven though l should be aroused with desire and driven mad by the
f. delights of love,
î For sure I would die with this writing-tablet of mine as a vehicle with its

be engaged in the business of seeking enchantment,

ḍt was then that Phalguṇātmaja stealthily set out, afraid that people

His excuse was that he was going to seek the favour of the gods with
only his servant Jurudyah as company.

When he arrived at Pragupta's place he came to mcet him and had

already prepared a way,

So he just went into the garden, leaving his servant behind, sighing and
at a loss what to do.

Now when he came there he found Sudarpaṇa who greeted him:

'Young man, why are you so forgetful? I cannot bear it, impatiently
waiting for you.

I will leave you for a moment now, and go and call your little sister.’

These were her words as she returmed by way of the wall to inform the

/My lady, the one who is longing for the sweetness of your glance as you
l smile has arrived.

'He is alone and is waiting in the garden, burning with impatience for

you to continue taking pity on him and showing him śavour.
What is the reason you look away in annoyance, or crease your brows in
a sudden frown?

j Then he might go away again, as he is superior by nature, very proud of

being rich in sweetness.

l Nol Why do you hesitate? Do you want to be the end of me?
L lf you go on resisting him and being unwilling he might use his sharp

dagger for stabbing.

k That is why you should stop worrying if your maidservant should die -

just accept it.

Let me stab myself - I will not be able to consider dying with the shame

of being rejected.*

, This is what she said to the princess, about how she seemed to be

resisting his love,
But it was merely from the depth of her fear and shyness that she
restrained the longing in her heart.

> Then when her lady raised her hand to stab herself this was reason for

\My lady, noble maid, come - is this still the real world?
ĕ No, I had imagined there was no life to be awaited by one who suffers

her to go ahead, troubled, weak and languishing,
pw trembling on the steps over the wall she shyly looked away as her
loved one received her.

'When they reached the bower of creepers he coaxed herarḍāīūressed>
her with gentle words:

the pain of being afflicted with lo-e.

'And I reflected on how far away your sympathy might be, or that you

might be moved to compassion for someone struck by heartache.

 Atter the princess had been overcome, she was exhausted and drained of
strength

p At the wetness of her dress, and this caused her to faint away.

b Ardently comforted, but limp and languid as a plucked blossom of the
b  wana,
 She still did not blink, was sprinkled with betel and gently caressed.

! Dhanañjātmaja was perplexed and took her on his lap, wearily
ś lamenting:
ṭ My dear, my lady, come, little sister, wake up, speak to me!

Come, I shall give you anything you desire, providing you frownonme -

Hal It was exceedingly wicked of me to cause you pain - it was very
wrong}

î This is how he lamented, seeking her pity with the utmost effort,
And his tears wet the princesss chest.

, Their stream suffused her soul like the water of life, deep and refreshing,
k| And so then she sighed and trembled, woke up and put her dress in

order.

She did not cease weeping, constantly sobbing softly,

Puzzled as to what would be best to do, weak, distressed and lost.

She did not realize she would be treated like this, or that his actions
would end up this way -

L He would of course be there to come before to her and just have a chat.

. And pleasant in every way were the words that enraptured and made

h He said,'Come, my dear, do whatever you like to your servant -
î Even if he has to be scratched, so be it; let him be chopped to bits if you
are furious.

j It would be good fortune to accept it, in view of the seriousness of my

Lady, this service is to be hoped for, so that I can reuite your kindness.

h Ask me whether l am not sorry for the pain I caused you,

ñ Ordo you not know that I longed for you and wept over you again and

! And if I do not succeed in dying by coming to you,

Then you should pay no heed if I am put to death.

. But I had not guessed that you would be cross at my being attached to
i you,
i Because of the depth of this passion, clinging close to the heart.
In the beginning, even when you were not to be seen, I always held you

Translation, Canto 27 159

When you suddenly came where I was, charming and unattended,

j Then I felt I would die of rapture, and did not know what to do for my
lovesickness.

| When you went back to the palace again, my dear, I could not picture
you in my mind,

§ And this is the reason I come, regardless of the fact I may end up dying. .

But you are just proud and turn away in silence, aloof,

Or you are annoyed and feel uneasy when l come near to express my
love and care for you.

Such were his words, and the lovely lady replied, softly and
tremulously:

p ‘Sh! Fine words, but always untrue. For me it's too late anyway.k

. This was the pining lady’s answer, and her lover took an oath to her:

‘Lady, let my oath be that if l dare to be separated from you for a
momenrt,

î I will die, thrown down on your breast in the midst of lovemaking -

Let me be slashed by your eyebrows, stabbed by your glances, and
poisoned with your kindness.

This ishow he took an oath, constantly embracing and kissing her.

And this gently spread and pervaded the lady's soul, putting an end to
her pitiful feelings.

 For this reason they felt that they shared one heart, one passion,
: Thirsting for the delights of words, not spoken aloud but in whispers.

î
î

* Moreover she was made familiar with what to do, and was trained -

l When he persisted and made her accustomed to it, more and more her
annoyance abated.

fi Because of their shareu joy, happily they were one in looking, one in
laughing, and one in rapture -

ḍ Because they were so absorbed in expressing their love and revealing

! Tock! The seventh hour struck, as if sounding a wamning;

t ‘People in the midst of the enjoyments of the senses should not be too
attached,

Because of their evils, say the scriptures’, so it seemed to say.

On the alert, Sudarpaṇa urgently told them to go back:

'Come, young man, it is almost day. Consider the dangers of your
actions!

Thus she spoke, but the two were eually unafraid that it might end in

death -

They went on regardless, even if they should be cut to shreds, rather
than be parted.

®i He said, ‘Alas, sister, what would become of me if I were parted from
my little sister?
î Surely my death would be rapturous, full of beauty, carried away.
It would be best for us two to run away and try to take refuge on the

ś seashore,
ĕl And as for our supplies of food, they would be the herbs of the fields,
ḍ even with yams for our cooked rice.

j Any remote, solitary hermitage might serve as our hideaway,

And we would be happy to live the lives of ascetics, provided we can
devote ourselves to sharing our yearning.

without delay.

Ihe butt of his fierce anger was Pārthatanaya’s insolence,

Which also had its origin in his father and likewise his mother;

It was a use of force that ended in a dreadful battle, crushing each other
on the battlefield,

And now that he had grown up he came to inherit the tendency to bad
behaviour.

}le would have killed him, but it happened that the Yadus blocked it:
ey hid him and kept him in a secret place, till later that night he could
depart.

But now that his master was in trouble he was far from being able to be

lAnd could only resign himself to joining him in death out of the depth of

But he (Abhimanyu) did not know where his thoughts or actions might

When Pārthatanaya had gone and was there in the sky,

Karāla watched over him and his servant, carefully on his head.

The distance to be covered was completed and faded, as it went as guick
as a flash -

The god's endowment with supematural knowledge caused it to vanish
into nothingness when they tried to picture it.

We pass over how he arrived in Porabhaya and took up lodging in the
fragrant garden,

And then the demon said goodbye, and he was left behind with his
servant.

He stayed there beneath a râjasa tree on the rocky bank of a clear
fountain,

Waiting till the night had passed and the glow of the sun was about to

Then it was day and soon the Lord Sun emerged shining brightly,

As if greeting the new arrival, who had come unnoticed and was
absorbed in viewing the lovely garden.

The bees headed for the flowers, as if intentionally pointing them out
and telling him to use them as an ornament for his ears,

And the birdr excitedly called in the fruit-trees, informing him about the

delicious taste of the fruits just ripening there.

Then he came down to wash his face and rinse his mouth, while keeping
silent in concentrated yoga;
 He carried out a libation of water while facing in the direction of the
l Lord Sun.
ḍ Then he saw the 'red eyes® glinting and darting to and fro as if nudging
him to come,
And the pike swam in a circlc as if welcoming the guest and telling him
k to drink the water and not fail to take his ñll.

Rê After some time passed in this way, soon there was an old demon who

camre;
p He was carrying a key and a broom, as it was his job to keep the garden
in order. -

 As soon as he saw him he was annoyed, and was about to lose his

î  temper and fiercely attack,

# But had a suspicion about his appearance, and so came forward and
addressed him in a respectful tone:

öuch were his uestions to him. Then he told him that he was a sorry

'Who had come intending to pay homage to Ghaṭotkaca, in the hope of
. his kind sympathy.
This is what he said, and the one addressed was moved and respectfully
h informed the demon king.
rne he was told, the king was astonished by the extraordinary story
and for this reason he came in haste.

When he arrived at the garden, he found him in a pitiful state, a sad
 sight.
$le hastened to make a reverential obeisance, and then was uestioned

"Young man, what is your reason for coming? lt is as if you are suffering

Ihese were the demon kings ḍuestions to him, in the midst of
bewilderment,

But he did not answer, as he was absorbed in trying the control his

j depression.

ht was Jurudyah who revealed everything about him -

Prostrating himself at the feet of the king, he said, asking for forgiveness:

our servant respectfully submits that Your Majesty’s supposition is
k correct.

Ric is a son of Arjuna, and Abhimanyu is his name, fittingly.

ĕle is famous on his mothers side, as a son of Subhadrā,

R\nd is thus related to King Dāmodhara as his nephew.

h, fact he comes here to prostrate himself and wipe your feet,
Pocause of his grief that the daughter of Rukmiṇī has been seized and

ḍ taken away.
fhe noble Baladewa has cruelly exercised his power and ordered it,
Rôeliberately arranging an immediate marriage to Laksanakumāra, and it
ĕ is already agrerd.

Bn the other hand Harimūrti was repeatedly asked to be allowed to

h favour her,

ĕs he was inclined to agree to his daughter's choice.

JPowever, it happens that he is not there, but has gone away to seek the
ś gods’ favour,

ĕnd so it is your kindness that Your Majesty's younger cousin awaits.

So said Ghaṭotkaca, and led the prince by the hand,

'And when they had come inside Abhimanyu once more bowed to him,
'But the one to whom he bowed refused, saying, ‘Don t do that,

[i's not what a nobleman should du to the likes of me, of the demon race.

I'Your devotion is irm, and that is my debt.

For that reason let me repay it with unparalleled affection.'

k So he said, and welcomed him with a gift of betel on a cushion of
peacock feathers,

 As well as rich garments to change into und brightly shining
adornments.

But it was in vain, for there was nothing that took the prince’s fancy,
ê No women to be enjoyed, no favours of drink or meats,

R No performances, tired of the sound of the mrdangga,

No songs and not even the enchanting beauties of the woods.

R In short for the three nights he was there
] He was constantly entertained day and night with an abundance of
enjoyments,

î But he paid no attention at all to food or sleep -

ê The only thing that might please him would be to see the lady who gave
him such pain and longing.

r

R Ghatotkaca was deeply moved to see him becoming all the more
J dejected,

 Uninterruptedly just wiping his tears because of his despair.

R So this is why he made ready for a swift departure,

f And the next morning the assembled troops were given their orders.

Marching together and pushing cach other they went in close formation

Like a Aock of rice-birds flying in waves, to be seen turning to and fro.

 There were none who wanted to be all alone at the rear, and grew more

and more at the front,

ĕ Fearful they might be cut off from their supplies - if they were too slow

they might be left behind on the march.

 It would take too long to tell about the time they took on their journey -
they were as fast as winking,

And in the meantime had arrived at the land of Harimūrti and looked
down onit from close by:

R There was a broad forest with undergrowth dark and scary at the foot of

the mountain,

' And there they headed to busily make preparations as a place to spend
the night.

b The sun's rays began to grow dim and it had almost set, riding on the
mountains,

 And at that moment he came down with his troops and made himself a
camp.

J The demon maidens were delighted and with their companions were

ĕ And even the horses and elephants were happy as they came to the
water, were bathed and carefully tended.

î They were perplexed as to the best thing to do and at a loss at the failure
of the one who had gone secretly into the mountains to arrive.

k The people within Baladewa's palace were just eating, drinking and
satisfying their senses,

As indeed it was the eve of the wedding, and all the arrangements were
ś equally amazing and extraordinary.

 There was lady Kṣiti Sundarī, who had been through the piḍiḍuk
ceremony and was placed in a lovely garden;

This made Lakṣaṇakumāra cautious and not in too much of a hurṛy,
J And while striving for secrecy he informed Kurupat.

ê Suyodhana was ḍuite relaxed about it, as if he had known for a long
time:

h Formerly he had suspected this, and now that he found it was true, that
j made him smile.

It was not just a jewel of a woman that was his object - if successful that
B would be lucky,

p But if he did not succeed, then victory would be a gain from attacking
f the Yadu tribe.

] And so the armed men were all prcsent, shouting loudly, including
* elephants and chariots,

f And as a precaution he had invited the vassal kings to come with their
troops.

ḍ Now, however, there was an evil portent he heard, loud and clear,
J But it did not shock him - he scarched for secret strategies.
f For this reason he took Bajradanta aside and whispered to him,

Telling him he should kill Ghaṭotkaca by taking on the body of the
k prince.

R Bajradanta had no objection; he was won over and felt he was being
. donea favour,

ṭ And he held firmly to his anger toward Bhīmasena, who had killed his
k  father.

k The plan was in place and moreover there was no one else who knew
ī about what was being done,

He said, and delightedly took him on, giving him a kick and a slap,

Then immediately they started fighting, constantly locked in close
combat, tearing at each's nose;

They were fierce as they blindly poked each other in the eye, throttled
each other and grappled each other -

Wilder and wilder they rolled each other over, tirelessly clashing,

forcefully colliding.

They got completely carried away and finally were like mountains
closing and meeting;

The building was smashed, trampled in their close combat as they
pursued each other.

The wedding guests were startled and in panic ran away, stricken with
fear,

The whole palace was intent on fleeing and all of Baladewa’s men were

powerless and seized with trembling.

Practically none of the heroes would have known what was happening
to the two locked in embrace,

 lf Bajradanta had not been killed - when he seized him he hurled him

downṇy
Ghatotkaca's boasts were that he was the supreme warrior,

And the corpse of the demon was torn apart, hurled away and thrown
straight at them.

To all appearances the army was in the mood to make war, shouting and

milling about restlessly,

L But Bhrmasunu had gone up into the sky with the maidservant and had

vanished in the distance.

Even though it was night, it was bright because of the gleam of the many
breastplates and collars,

And so this is why they went straight on, swiftly and without
obstruction.

Arriving in Dwārawatī they went inside the fort and attacked at close
Quarters,

Śpreading out in great numbers to set fire to the dwellings and go and
trample the sleepers.

The Yadu tribe were taken by surprise and bewildered; on guard they
tried to ight with all their might,

And could almost not care about the full number of weapons for
warding them off as they mounted a wild attack.

or this reason they had just stood up, suffering losses in front, falling
scattered everywhere,

Pressed again and again, attacked furiously, driven into a corner and
hard pressed, they withdrew in the direction of the narrows.

Moreover Ghatotkaca had just arrived, having recently been called to
assist,

And his champions spread far and wide, uttering challenging yells from
the sky.

The Korawa army withdrew and sought their chiefs to gather,

And cautiously prepared to take up positions in order to stand firm out

of fear of being battered.

Translation, Canto 40 233

Bhagadatta, Māalawa and Jayadratha formed his ‘fangs and flanked the
battle-array,

In order to enclose it if it should be overcome and pushed back from the
front.

Ard likewire at the rear any number of kings were drawn up and

standing ready;

Their weapons were like a sea of fire, with as smoke the banners

clashing together.

There were already freuent signs of preparing a firm battle-line, lacking
any dangers,

Like a mountain with ridges, gullies, crags and thick forests;

Within it lions with bears and tigers uninterruptedly snarled -

This was clearly the idea formed by the tightly packed ranks of shouting
troops.

 There was nothing that one could imagine might trighten the king of

Hastina,

- That he had set aside, even though he was going into the midst of enemy

- territory.

Given the fact that Baladewa was there, he could not possibly be hostile,
And even if Harimūrti should hinder him, why worry if he should make
war! '

 Realizing the facts of the matter Haladhara was at a loss and very

embarrassed:

If he should make war and oppuse the Yadu tribe, what good would that
do?

King Hastineśwara on the other hand should be repelled together with
the Yadus,

As he was ashaṇṇed at the abortive attempt to marry off the lady due to
the presence "of Ghatotkaca.

Or else Ghaṭotkaca should be confronted in the midst of the battlefield,

Assembled with the Yadu tribe - this was the proper basis for all
pleasure and displeasure.

These things he put aside and finally gave himself up to musing,

Just standing there and thinking things over with the troops, bemused as

to what to do.

We pass over how Baladewṅ was perplexed as to what to do and kept
his distance in the midst of his confusion;

He took no notice of how the Yadu tribe was furiously overwhelming
the enemy.

The battle was in full swing, locked in close combat and embracing,
neither wishing to retreat,

Suffering losses by the thousand or by the ten thousand, their corpses
unheeded.

b keuê: F kewĕh.

 The troops were skilled at seeking out their match, and bearing down on
each other they made a thunderous noise.

See, the ones in chariots clashed with chariots, and when riding
ī elephants with elephants,
Not to mention the ones on horseback who clashed in close combat, all
on horses,
L Slashed and being slashed, charging and being charged, trampling each
other, never thinking of the dead.

Then the Korawa men were beaten, having just been swept away, fallen
and scattered, terrified;

. Their battle-line was broken, they werṣ fearful and carried away, and all

the kings were in disorder.

s They would almost have been totally wiped out if the Korawa king had

Translation, Canto 41 239

Bhrṣmna, Droṇa, Jayadratha and Krṛpa as well as Bhūriśrawa supported

them,

lAnd Karṇa, Alĕmbana and Alĕmbuṣa joined in with the army of heroes

accompanying them.

They all rushed forward with powerful weapons, thundering like a rain
of arrows, l

And the battlefield was a flood of blood, spilling from the corpses, piled

as high as a mountain.

The Yadu tribe did not know what to do because of the overwhelming
numbers of elephants and chariots,

And then they were in trouble and withdrew, unable to ward off the
arrows that fell in ever increasing numbers.

This is why they fell into disorder and fled, without any thought of

stopping,

Śwept away, without expecting to live, giving up, scared, panting, worn

out and stricken with fear.

Then King Ghaṭotkaca swooped in a throng with the host of demons,
Like a cloud engulfing them from the sky they seized the enemy
unimpeded;

The ones they caught they chewed, constantly drinking blood that made
them all the more intoxicated,

And their belches were as loud as the thunderclaps, as they rained down
heads, hands and thighs.

They could just do this as much as they liked, as of course they had to be
opposed by those looking up in order to fight,

. And no matter how many there were they rained down spears and
lances on them.

Then it came about that Abhimanyu advanced, charging in with
indomitable spirit,

Without fear and constantly covered like the sun at midday, and thus
the enemies were like the mist.

to be avoided and what was to be done:

'Oh Duryodhana, go and seek out lîaladhara, as he is the only proper
refuge for you.

Make every effort to put your hands together in respect for him, and
wait on him close by at his rear.

Translation, Canto 42 247

But how could I possibly come or be called by Your Majesty if I knew
what to do?

I was merely mindful of your wisdom, as praised by the three worlds.

And as for your suddenly becoming false or deceitful - how could Your
Majesty ever do that?

In view of this, come, what possible reason could l have not to seek to
put a ḍuestion?

These were the words addressed by Suyodhana to King Baladewa,
perplexed and dejected.

The king asked forgiveness from him for his miserable state, being
worried and not knowing what to do.

In view of his message to the Yadus asking them not to impede him,

. Or even to kill Suyodhana, King Baladewa strove to evade him:

‘My sons, the Yadus and Ghaṭotkaca, listen to me for a moment.

lf Suyodhana were done away with, clearly I would just be ridiculed by
the whole world.

You yourselves would encounter trouble - come, how could lsit idly

. by?

But it would be best just to break up this fight - it would be right to do
whatever might be fitting and proper.k

This is what Haladhara said to restrain the Yadus, but they took no

notice;

They were furious with Suyodhana, at the way he recklessly had no
respect and kept seeking to injure them.

For this reason Ghaṭotkaca's forces surrounded him and the Yadu forces
and Abhimanyu went on the offensive,

Wishing to overpower Suyodhanas forces, undeterred by the king.

At the time when Baladewa was clenching his teeth in anger and was
frightfully big while in his krṅuvikramz form,

The earth guaked, the mountains collapsed, and the waters of the sea
were scooped up and surged thunderously.

The siddhas and sages greeted this in the sky with loud cries of 'Victory,
victory! and scattered flowers:

'May the kings’ ḍuarrel be settled, otherwise the whole world will be
involved and break up~

Such were their words. How lucky, for how would the Yadus have
survived,

If King Harimūrti had not arrived and embraced the feet of the king?

He had hurried swiftly back from the mountain when informed by the
great sage Nārada,

And so now that he had come he respectfully tried to soothe his elder
brother with charming words:

‘Oh, the humble obeisance of Your Majesty's servant - heed the sincere
reuest of yuur younger brother:

. Your desire to kill the Yadus is a personal matter of yours, nothing else.
. Their sins in yielding to the reckless conduct of your nephew should

truly be ignored, that would be best,:
For it would go on too long, and furthermore who else will be concerned
about the kind of upbringing that would be proper for him?

Translation, Canto 43 253

Hence how could I possibly oppose whatever you may have in mind
regarding the princess's marriage?

Moreover this Lakṣaṇakumāra is suitable - handsome, with good
qualities and accomplished.

But it would have been better to wait and inform me, so that it could
have been a result of serving you -

My idea is to join in caring tor you with all my strength, and be involved
in Your Majesty’s affairs.

Well, what [ now reḍuest is that ! should not be embarrassed or afraid of
încurring ill fame,

And King Koraweśwara not be involved in whatever my business might
be.

For if I follow unthinkingly in what I do, or am not firm in what is a
proper course of action,

It is plainly shameṭul, and for this reason I am simply asking you to let

.go of it in your mind.|

So said Kṛṣṇa in order to set Baladewa’s mind at rest, even including
Hastineśwara,

And when they had realized that this was for the very best, how could
they.possibly oppose it?

So this was why Suyodhana took leave to reum home with his
followers unobtrusively,

Not knowing of course that Harimūrti would not tell Haladhara to
answer in this way.

He did not dare to persist with his aggression if the Yadus were going to
beat him to it -

The destruction of Dwārawatr was what he wanted, and it was proper to
blame his deceptive appearance.

This made him hurry home on the pretext of being afraid and the troops
downcast and ashamed,

Concerned that someone would hold him back from getting away like a
thief caugh in the act - why would he not be embarrassed?

Translation, Canto 43 255

All of a sudden Kiîng Baladewa was calm again and happy that King
Keśawa had arrived.

It was not his tolerance of his wrong answer to him that was his reason
for suppressing his anger.

Now that he was being asked to cease his anger, he felt happy. deeply
moved and elated -

Just like ‘water chopped’ is the unhappiness of a virtuous man such as
he, so how could he possibly emulate an evildoer?

Then the Yadus, Ghaṭotkaca and Abhimanyu uickly came before him
with due respect,

And attentively kissed thc dust at the feet of the king and King Keśawa.

Baladewa said: 'Welcome, my boys. Do not go back to your bad ways.

When the moral laws have been broken, even if it continues, this should
be tolerated and disregarded.

So he said, gently calming those who were begging for his kindness and
hoping that his great anger would subside,

For kindling the fires of anger when done all together has results that
defy description.

Now that Janārdana had come to repair matters, they were extinguished,
composed and put away,

And this is why happiness took the place of pain, as if sprinkled with the
water of life.

Moreover those who have acguired mgrit for being valiant in battle
should be allowed to obtain the proñt;

See how the rewards increase: the gifts will be in accordance with their
virtues and they will enjoy a noble status.

The attire of a warrior together with a singhĕ! with a neckband and a
collar will be promoted to a higher level -

Such is the fear and at the same time longing, bewildered as to what to
do, leading to being unashamed and always boasting.

ê It would take too long to tell about the warriors, eually incomparable -
[ The holy Sun finally sank in the west and stood upon the mountain

l As if tired of watching the frightful battle, very extraordinary,

? And so it ordered those who had won fame to return home.

Baladewa returned home, constantly attended by the Yadus,

R Sharing a lovely chariot with his younger brother and having a relaxed
conversation together.

We pass over them on the way; let us speak of those who were smitten
with love,

Disturbed at the trembling of their hearts, moved and a prey to their
emotions.

lndeed how would a wife who loved her husband not tremble,

Seeing how their neighbours were crying out loudly and wailing,

At their grief on hearing of the death of their defeated loved one,

While others went around searching for the body of their man on the
battlefield.

«

Some forgot that their dress had come loose, stunned, hurrying, restless,

Resting their chins on their hands, half-dressed, with loosened hair
hanging carelessly,

Musing while glancing at the door, listening for his voice, always
wondering,

And filled with longing to see their loved one, or in fear of being told of

his death.

Translution, Canto 44 259

Some were getting dressed and carefully adjusting their head-band, with
sweet-smclling flowers arranged in it,

Wearing a dress with a girdle in ‘banana-bud’ style, and at their ease
applying a warming make-up.

There were of course two reasons for their hesitation and not to rush in
and join them indying,

And luckily when their husband came they could happily enjoy the
delights of lovemaking,

And those who had been counting on his devoted love when their man
came,

With eyebrows blackened with charcoal at that moment would have
tears as water for greeting him,

And they would take a sweet smile to replace the trembling of the
warrior,

The heart to be brought back to life, to be carried away with the delights
of love.

Others understood about their husband’s valour and how he would be
far from dying,
But even so had their suspicions and were always worried that he might
. have got a woman captive.
His affection before had been greaṭ, as if he could not leave her behind,
But he became accustomed to being separated with the arrival of a
lovely newcomer.
It would be too much to tell about what they did; the King finally
arrived,
And the troops returned home, greeted by their loved ones, happily
united in love.
The noble Harimūrti went straight into the inner palace,
And the worthy Abhimanyu was brought straight in with the charming
lady.

Translation, Canto 44 261

Only later would they come out, and would certainly be married,

But this would have to await the arrival of the Five Paṇḍawa kings later
on,

As it seemed likely that they were on the point of coming, having
fulfilled the appointed time;

Apparently this would not bc postponed, and this was the time to be
aimed at. .

The happiness of the whole country was clear to see,
And in the first place the queen was supremely delighted.

Subseḍuently Pārthasuta’s mother was deeply moved when invited to
come and wept,

} And kept hugging her son, feeling he had been brought back to life.

Night came and it would be too much to tell about them sleeping in the
palace,

Including the prince and the beautiful lady, according to the doings of
lovers.

Time passed and the passage of night and day need not be spoken of;
Ghaṭotkaca returned home, having been treated with unparalleled care
and attention.

Now when Ghaṭotkaca had returned Dhanañjayasuta was left behind,
happy to be with the charming lady,
And they enjoyed themselves in mutual affection making love day and
. night, never leaving the bedroom.
The love they had longed for before they found and now made a reality,
And because they had kept their vow so long, their thirst when breaking
the fast was sweet pleasure.

It went so far that they even could not be separated, like a pair of himi-
himi crabs together,

Gracefully leading each other by the hand, their deportment like
shadows, they were always so close to each other.

But with a hint of greed in their desire to be one in essence, being of one
body would of course be better,

And their tear was of being disappointed when looking away, or not
seeing at the moment of blinking an eye.

It was as i[ they were standing guard over the garden, always absorbed
in the bower of creepers and often making lovet

If feeling hot they bathed in the lake, doing it any way they liked and
laughing together, splashing. N

Having come out ot the water they dressed, adornirg each other and
arranging the flowers in each other’s hair -

The mirror was of no use to them both if it shifted the focus of the
pleasures of being in love together.

And how much more when sharing the ultimate happiness, without

Tîme passed and after a while unhappiness came again to the princess -

Indeed just as the alternation of day and night, good and evil go
constantly hand in hand.

Now the manner of this was the arrival of a messenger from the
Pāaṇḍawa king as the foremost among the elders,

With the intention of inviting King Keśawa to come, and
Dhanaṅjayasuta was to be the main one to attend him.

For it was already clear that they would be released after the time agreed
had elapsed,

And the only matter to be discussed was the future arrangement of the
country, which had been temporarily ruled by the king of Hastina.

This put the Five Pāṇḍawas at their ease, while waiting out their time in
the kingdom of Wirāṭa,

Constantly eager for the coming of Janārdana, who would approve the
plans for what would be best for the future.

Such indeed were the words of the emissary, reporting to Harimarti and
his brother;

They were both extremely pleased, and for this reason it was agreed that
they wouuld set out the next morning.

But just the noble Kṛṣṇa would go, and Langgaladhara would reinforce
the protection of this own kingdom,

And it was only the Wṛṣṇis and Abhimanyu with his mother who were
instructed to join in and were already standing by.

4 However, Dhanañjayasuta was extremely reluctant, and begged the king
to stay behind or else to follow later,

Because he was concerned about being separated from the princess, had
just found happiness and they had not yet had enough of loving each
other.

But the king insisted and might possibly impose a curse, so for this
reason he was stultified and wept non-stop,

Swooning with his head on his beloved's lap, tossing and turning,
sobbing, not knowing what to do for the best.

‘Ah. my treasure, my lady, come, little sister, what should l do with
regard to the king?

He insists on ordering me to join him, leaving without delay for the
country of Wirāṭa.

Furthermore, even if my father takes good care of me, how could l be
parted from you?

How could the bee not die if it were separated from the perfume of
sweet flowers?

Then let me persist in refusing, and if it should end in death, this is what
they call a sure thing.

Iam not afraid of dying, but it is his curse that I fear, as its power to
inflict misfortune is plain.

This is what leads to confusion, and so you should cease worrying and
clear your mind.

Itake leave to go and die of lovesickness and longing for you, and this

sweetness of yours is what I weep over when about to be parted from
you.

Such was Pārthatanaya's lament, taking leave of the princess.

Deeply moved the lovely lady repligd, trembling in her heart, with tears
unceasing,

Faint and indistinct, downhearted, making her forget because of the
oppressed feeling in her heart,

Constantly trying to interpret the lack of meaning, because of the breaks
in his tremulous words.

She said: 'How could l, brother, be careless about it or refuse?

Being united in spirit and in action with one such as you in whatever
you desire would be wrong to resist.

Only awaiting your affection if you are kindly disposed is my way,
serving you with my love,

But if you have no affection, what can I do? Plainly I will resign myself
to dying of lovesickness.

Regardless of how you might be engaged in exploring charming things,

Do not get too carried away, restrain your longing, intersperse it with a
song.

Remember my pain here, left behind and sad at heart, weary and
weeping. h

If you take betel, divide the uid in half with your teeth and call me,
longing for you.

Translation, Canto 47 275

And while you are roaming about to amuse yourself with a friend and
going to the seashore,

Be affectionate to the one who subjects you to longing as you lie
languidly on her lap.

Do not blame her, be agregable to whatever she wants, and go along
with her passion and attachment.

You should just ignore me, left behind and neglected - what does it
matter if I die!

Let me just hope that in another incarnation I will find favour with you
laṭer on,

And for this I would like to turn into a well-made writing-tablet for you
to carry while musing.

It would be fun to be held on your lap when you composed a song as a
place where your kindness might be found,

And there I would fade away, so that I could disappoint you in return
and oppress your heart.

CANTO/48

Such were the words of the two, distractedly weeping together and
swearing to love each other. ,

It would take too long to relate how in tumns for the whole night they
fainted away and helped each other.

At daybreak it was fear that the king would be angry that caused him to
go straight to join him,

For he had already mounted his chariot, and naturally he would be the
leader of the procession.

The escort was complete, and the Yadus were drawn up in due order,

Each charmingly riding in a chariut, with armed men as followers and
guards.

They were well on their way, enjoying the scenery as they passed
through thick forest on the edge of the hills -

It was dimly beautiful, and if it were to be described clearly it would
stick in the poets mind.

Let us go back to the story, and tell about the lady left behind, longing
for her husband:

To make matters worsc, she was struck by a curse, and this was the
reason she was so perturbed she felt she would die, fainting away and
weeping.

Indeed the cause of her misfortune was a failure in her reception of the
great sage Nārada when he arrived

To pay her a visit, out of his great joy that her marriage to Abhimanyu
would take place.

Translation, Canto 48 2799

Foot-washing water with mouth-wash and fine betel on a cushion came,

But even so the dreaming lady herself did not come, she was completely
oblivious, and the water for washing feet was useless.

For this reason the great sage uttered a curse on the forgetful lady for
failing to pay due homage:

'Well, may you be made inferior to a co-wife, due to my disappointment
with you! Fie!

Such were the words of the great sage from the sky, and when called
back he did not return.

The pining lady left there was all the more perplexed, speechless, deep
in thought and overwhelmed with emotion.

Passing over how she was enduring anxiety, let us move straight on and
describe the kings progress:

He was on his way but repcatedly passed the night on his long journey
and was not in a hurry to get there.

After a ce:tain number of nights he thereupon arrived in Wirāṭa at a
leisurely pace,

And there the Five Pāṇḍawas and King Mātsyapati greeted him, all
joyful and elated.

When he had taken his lodgings in a dwelling arranged as a palace, the
offerings to him were numerous and thick with flowers,

He was feted, hospitably entertained and regaled with delightful things,
enjoying the six flavours to the full.

Passing this over, the next morning they then gathered and consulted in
the hall:

The honourable Mātsyapati, the Five Pāṇḍawas and the kings showed
their devotion first,

And talked about how they would tackle Kurunātha, and all the officers
were ready for action,

But the final outcome of their planning was just ñrst to ask for the
kingdom.

8 Likewise Yudhiṣṭhira strove to show his respect for King Keśawa,
And with an añjali he urged Janârdana strongly to come to Gajāhwaya,
As he would be able to take over the rights to the country again and
would raise the matter with Suyodhana -
[t was Harimuirti's power that the Five Pāṇuḍawas would use as their
support.

9 How could Keśawa refuse? It was already agreed that they would set
out in the near future,

But Abhimanyu and his mother he handed over to Dhanañjaya.
And regarding the marriage of Parthasuta without his instruction and all

that the boy did,

For thesw: things he asked his indulgence and not to go ahead with
punishment.

0 ‘Forgive me, younger brother Arjuna, and especially at the feet of
- Yudhigṭhira.

dl Your order to me was to watch over my nephew, to take care of him and
ṛṛ comfort him.
) But as for this incorrect behaviour with his cousin, making love with her,

I'beg your indulgence of me (your elder brother) for going too far, as I
did not punish him~

11 So spoke Keśawa, and Arjuna responded calmly with joy in his heart:
‘Oh, l am supremely pleased at your words, sympathizing with the boy.
How could it possibly have ended, if Your Majesty had been affected

| with deep anger? .

, So let your favour toward him continue - let this just serve as a

meritorious deed.

12 However, to change the subject, may Your Majesty reflect on something
very much on my mind,
In view of the fact that an undertaking was made to Mātsyapati that he
would be given my son, and so it was agreed.
This is causing me to be concerned about whether it would be wrong to
go ahead with it, and who would be senior.

This is what Pârtha said, and Keśawa replied, forced by the power of the
sage’s Curse:

13 'My younger brother Dhanañjaya, I already know that you are devoted
to me.

See, old chap, you must not have a problem if the one called Uttarī is
acknowledgcrd in this position.

The way will be to follow the decree of her father, and let her be married
to him,

And so let my daughter be replaced as first - I would have no worries if
this were done

4 Thus spoke Keśawa, confirming the correctness of it, approved as right
even inside the palace,

But the young lady had a difficulty, fearful that she might appear to be
going counter to Janārdana.

But if the king insisted, then he should grant her a favour as a sign of the
depth oṭ his feelings:

That if she went on to have a son, he wvould just resemble him - that was
her request, according to her confidante.

15 So such was the prayer of the princess to Keśawa,

Sweetly set down ina lovely letter, charmingly accompanied by kaki
flowers.

It was offered with an obeisance by the puyang and iña, who attentively
presented it to him, wiping his feet;

The kings heart was moved by it and he trembled, grateful for the
words uf endearment.

Translation, Canṭo 48 285
284 Text, Canlo 4ĕ

Although he was visibly bewildered, nevertheless he confirmed his
faithfulness to his word,

And for this reason went ahead and agreed to everything that the
princess asked for.

Not long after that her wedding finally went ahead, amazingly ñtting,

And it was as if the whole of heaven would be completely empty,
wanting to join in watching, as far as the corners of the world.

CANTO49

Now when the wedding had been celebrated in Wirāṭa with the full
ceremonies, a marvellous sight,

Then the illustrious Kṛṣṇa replaced the bride with his own daughter and
married her off in his palace,

And Māatsyādhipa and the Five Pāṇḍawas came to escort
Dhanañjayātmaja -

The property of the whole kingdom was used up by the king, as he
multiplied tenfold the fitting offerings for the ceremonies before them.

ln shorṭ, following this, when Pārthasuta was happy with his two wives
and fulfilled the wishes of his loved ones,

Because he was respectful of Uttarī he joined her in being devoted to her
father and did not dare to refuse,

But as for Lady Kṣiti Sundarī, the fact that she had been struck by the
curse increased the sharp pain in his heart,

And furthermore he had been her companion before in a dangerous love
affair, and for this reason he felt sorry for her.

In this way the manner in which he gave priority to his love and passion
for Rukmiṛusutâ was subtle: .

When giving gifts he did it stealthily, and when coming to bed he
treated her to the delights of love;

If they went to enjoy themselves on a trip to the seashore and mountains
they were treated eually in admiring the beauties of nature,

But when the flowers were shared out he showed her that she was his
beloved with lis smile and with his glances filled with amorous
feelings.

The composition of the tale is already done - Ghaṭotkacaśaraṇa is its
name, without literary adornment.

It is not much, awkward and lacking in feeling are the words from the
mouth of Mpu Panuluh, offending against the rules of the metres.

May these results of attempting to sueeze out his thoughts be a vehicle
for carnying him home to the Abode of Anangga,

Seeing that he is weak from being worn out in poetry and decrepit in
musing, forgetful when looking at the beauties of secluded hermitages.

Fie, who would possibly dare to place himself on a par with the Court
Poet, skilled in things of beauty,

If the illustrious Madaharṣa had not insisted on issuing the instruction to
join him in producing a story in kakawin form?

But he succeeded in his wish to sec it, and laughed at how he drove me
to distraction -

I am not afraid to accept his whims and be ground to dust, providing I
can go back to enjoying his sympathy in times to come.
