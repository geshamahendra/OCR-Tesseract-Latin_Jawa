They were well-euipped with stones and mountains, followed by the
ordinary monkey-soldiers who were armed with branches of trees. They
attacked simultaneously, beating and stabbing wildly or throwing stones
ṇnd mountains which fell apart, emitting fre-sparks.

The one they attacked with their weapons was ṇot injured, the mountains
and stones were smashed on impact and turned to dust which billowed up
into the air looking very terrifying. The earth shook, and dust whirled up
when he was covered all over by monkeys.

Thunderstorm was ranging, dust was rising in billows, the monkey host
were in confusion. They could not see anything in the battlefeld as it was
pitch dark. Kumbhakarṇṇa was furious, like a rutting elephant. The
monkeys were trampled down and trodden, yelling out of pain by sevens or
fours.

Further there were monkeys he devoured, others were crushed or pinched
to death. Other monkeys were knocked on their heads, their eyes were
pulled out. There were others who were ung into the air blown by the
wind coming out of his nostrils, and many were sucked into his nose and
killed when they were dashed on the dried mucus which was like rocks.

The monkeys were destroyed and devoured- There were some who were
bitten, but still bit back and stabbed him, but he could not be injured, and
the monkeys were killed constantly with skinned bodies. Blood owed down.
Other monkeys turned pale as they were caught under stones which were
kicked off by his toes.

The monkeys were afraid and did not dare to attack, when they saw that
whoever came near was killed and nobody was alive. He was not a demon,
they thought, but the god of Death. That made them retreat again, their
ranks broken and could not regroup again.

if you let him have his way.

for battle. Sugrīwa was keen to gain fame in combat,so when he received
the order he was very pleased.

The king of the monkeys was like Indra, and the tree he stabbed with was

But his blows did not trouble the one he struck who was immovable.
Sugrīiwa stabbed again with the tree which was really powerful and hard,
nevertheless it did not hurt, and rebounded.

The king of the monkeys became more and more savage. His round eyes
rolled and his eyebrows knit, he howled dreadfully, kept his mouth open
[ready to bite], stood in position with his canine-teeth fiickering like light-
ning flashes.

His long, big tail was swaying, he pulled out trees near to him, so that the
nearby [trees] hindering his movement were all smashed. He grabbed those
trees on the ground, one in each hand and stabbed with them in turn.

Despite these Kumbhakarṇṇa was immovable and parried the blows off. He

As he felt perturbed by the blows and missiles, he held his sharp lance in
his hand with ease, its shaft was made of solid iron and very heavy, divided
into nodes by golden bands.

The lance rotated faster and faster and its ḍame was brighter and brighter,
reflected on his armour which was also shining. He looked like the Méry
mountain on fire when it was burnt by the twelve hundred sunṇs at the end
of the era.

God Indra was extremely pleased to see it. He praised [the exploit of
Hanūmān], saying ‘Good! Excellent? because in the past he was defeated
and knocked down [at full length] on the ground by the lance. That is why
he was very happy-

When Sugrīwa was seen to be carried away, the monkey host was in uproar.
They were sad and without hope of winning, because their king had been
beaten. Marutsuta did not loose his calmness, he chased the fleeing
Kumbhakarṇṇa.

Meanwhile Sugriwa came to and realised his dangerous position. He
looked for a trick- He pretended to close his eyes for awhile to clear his
mind. Suddenly he jumped up and succeeded in escaping and at the same
time bit off the nose and pulled off the ears of Kumbhakarṇṇa with his
sharp pointed nails (of his ngers).

The king of the monkeys escaped with the nose of Kumbhakarṇṇa who was
seething with fury as he was disgured. He was without nose and ears,
dumbfounded he was out of his mind with anger. He was ashamed to with-
draw as he had been tortured by his disfigurement. ‘It is better that I die,
he said in irritation. Without delay he turned back and devoured the
monkeys and drank their blood.

His two big legs were shot and severed, but then he walked on his knees

had two guardians, demons who were seasoned in battle, these were the

were intoxicated and experienced in battle, where they had slain thcir

At the assault of the sons of Daśānana, the monkey-host were destroyed and
pushed back. Attacked by new forces, they were downtrodden and over-
whelmed, as they were already exhausted. Aṅgada stood up with a huge
club in his hand and his heart was boiling. He took action against Naran-

The powerful Trikāya and Triśirāh attempted to counter his actions fercely
and furiously. Together with Déwāntaka they mobbed Aṅgada, who could
defend himself as he was experienced in mob-āghting. He evaded or parried
the blows [of his upponents] without blinking his eycs.

be treated thus. He pulled at Dêwāntaka and insulted him by hitting
slightly with the rock, followed with a punch, enough not to kill him, but to

His guardian Matta was killed easily clubbed by Śarabha, and Samaramatta
was smashed by Nīla with a huge rock. Forcefully Triśirāh attacked with
a sword spinning his hand. It was snatched by Anilātmaja and Triśirāh
was killed by his own sword.

The powerful Atikāya was left alone, but he hoped to fight long. His wagon
which was like a huge mountain was drawn by one thousand horses. The
monkeys were shouting in pain when they were run over by the wheels
which moved very swiftly. They were trodden on, bitten by the horses, who
trampled [powerfully] in their attempts to draw the wagon.

Young Lakṣmaṇa had pity with the monkeys who were wounded by the

Their arrows flew sigaling through the air and met midway in the air, and
they were burnt by the fre which came out on impact.

éAt length, this is my turn, my father. I must be killed if the enemy wants
to win. But Iam capable of fighting a thousand Rāmas, I will pulverise
them in no time. Give me leave to enter combat to destroy the monkey-
host and their cronies. With a touch of my [fnger] I can smash mountains,
let alone sinful mortals.

“They were like miserable deer and rabbits only pretending to do as-
ceticism in the forests, but they were not real ascetics, but sinful and
wicked murderers who made the vow of the heron. They were phony as-
cetics, who were like eggs, white outside, but rotten and stinking inside.
That is the resemblance of Rāma who thought to perform a vow [of charity],
but always murdering[demons]. That is why he will be slain.

Thus said Indrajit roaring like a lion, while standing courageously and
proudly. His father stopped worrying when he saw his son>s resolute behav-
iour. He went immediately out to the battleñeld, after he had prayed and
was granted a gift of a great wagon and the arrow wimokana (an arrow which
causes perplexity to the enemy) by a deity [to him].

When he went to battle, it was night and darkness was everywhere. The
ten directions were dark. Indrajit prayed in high spirit. He knew that
nobody could see him as hehad put on the spell adrĕṣu (invisible). He
shot at the monkey-host with his wimohana-arrow, which put them to sleep.

When the monkey-host was in deep slumber, Indrajit was laughing heartily
and loudly. There was no trouble for him to kill the monkeys in their sleep.
He is really bad without feeling bad at all. Hundreds, tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands were killed by him, as he discharged his arrows
incessantly. Those monkeys sleeping at a distance from Raghūttama were
all killed.

b. B ahurip. BDE mataṅ nyan. CD aharip. c. CE taman.

Only the highest ranking monkeys were sleeping near Raghūttama and they
were saved, though they were overcome by sleep caused by the sleeping
spell. Even Raghūttama was not free from the influence of the arrow of
perplexity. He felt sleepy and weary and wanted to sleep together with his
younger brother.

Ahter the exalted prince was overcome by the arrow of perplexity, the thief
returned home, because he was afraid that his uncle Wibhīṣaṇa would know
of his deed and take revenge on him. He could not be affected by the
sleeping spell, he did not fall asleep, but sat cross-legged while rubbing his
eyes which were always open and alert, due to his perfectly wise conduct.

His weapon of light (ḍpasaājata) was more powerful than the sleeping spell,
and that was the reason he was not affected by the arrow of perplexity. All
the time he sat still, keeping in mind and reciting the formula of alertness,
as he thought that the great culprit Indrajit would come to win the battle
by sly means.

Then he became suspicious, lit his torch and saw the king sleeping with
inverted eyes and foaming at the mouth as if he was possessed by a piśaca
(imp). The king also groaned and moaned like a person possessed [by evil
spirit]. He woke him up and asked him to wash his face. After doing thus
he was awake and was no longer drowsy.

b. BCE kataṅgalaṅ anon. D kataṅgala manon.

Also the king of the apes, Marutsuta, Nīla, Aṅgada were woken up. They
heard someone calling them vaguely, then they came to, and grinned at the
sight of the torch. Wibhīṣ”aṇa asked to light other torches so that the dead
could be seen. All the monkeys sleeping far away [from Rāma] had been
killed by the underhand warrior.

Raghūttama was extremely moved at the sight of the dead monkeys. Their
death was not the death of heroes, but they died at the hand of a sneaky
murderer. Thus Marutsuta was ordered to fetch the great cure which consists
of nectar (amrĕta), called the mahoṣadhilatū (the herb of the great cure), so
ṭhat the dead monkeys could be revived by the effectiveness of the herb.

The place, where the paramahoṣadki (the great cure) plant grew, was on the
top of the mountain of Himagiri. The herb known as wiśalyakāriyī (a herb
to cure wounds incurred by arrows) mrĕétajwwami (raising the dead to lifc)
braṇitasandhinṭ (curing the wounded) must be looked for. Without delay
Marutsuta went by air to Himagiri-mountain, and soon arrived there.

He stood there, confoundcd, as he did not know the herb of great cure.
At length he truncated the top of the mountain and lew with it. Soon he
arrived with roots and all, the herb of great cure was found in great
numbers. The noble [Wibhīṣaṇa] took some of them and sprinkled the dead
monkeys with it.

With a drop of the cure all the dead were revived. They stretched out and
yawned, wiping their eyes as if they had woken up from their sleep, still
feeling drowsy. When they licked the amrĕlu, though only a droplet, they
woke up and together raised a roar like a lion. Thcir hearts were eager to
return to the battlefeld, their hands were holding clubs.

Because of their anger that they were killed in their sleep, they burnt down
the city of Rāwaṇa which was reduced to ashes completely. The attendants
of Daśānana were amazed, shocked when they saw the palace burning.
Indrajit turned pale when he realized how guick the retaliations to his
actions were, and looked stupified.

The two brothers Kumbha and Nikumbha came out for the defence. Their
eyes looked like vessels of copper, dangerous red, round and wide. They
were the sons of Kumbhakarṇṇa, not surprising that they were huge as
mountains, and as mighty [as his father] in combat. In the past nobody
had been able to face them.

There were outstanding demons called Kampana, Akampana, Prajaṅgha,
Wilohitākṣa, Dhwajākṣa, who were known as mighty and skilled in combat.
They were the guardians of Nikumbha and Kumbha who wished to defeat
the monkey-host. They hoped to win by destroying them in a long, ferce
battle.

When the seven of them plunged into a Kerce attack without regard to their
life while making a strong defence without option of returning, they swooped
down as hot as the fre of Death burning and enclosing the monkey soldiers.
The units of the monkeys attacked by them were forcefully thrown back and
the bolder ones were defeated, and joined in. the confusion as their ranks
broke down like the sea at low tide, no longer strong.

Prince Rāghawa instantly gave the order to repulse the assault. Nobody
else but Aṅgada was so eager to stop them with counter-actjon. He was
awfully devouted and loyal to Raghūttama due to unlimjted admirarion. He
did not think about the death of his father, who had been improper in
conduct.

Besides he was appointed to the position of crownprince, as it wero,
enjoying the privileges of a king. That was the rcason he was so keen on
entering into combat, like a lover entering the bedchamber of his beloved.

. He cherished his devotion [to Rāma] in his heart as if it was a great temple,

in which Raghūttama was the bejewelled image, worshipped for ever.

hung out, then he punched him on his nose until it was flattened and his
eyes were pressed and fell out.

He snatched the banner of Dhwajākṣa and struck him with it till he fell to
the ground. He laid his knees on the back of the demon, and twisted his
neck off. Dwiwidha, the monkey with broad shoulders, came to the defence
brandishing a club against Wilohitākṣa who looked like Takṣaka in battle,
but he was smashed to death.

The monkey [leader] Mainda swung his club around, joined in the fighting

He was in great trouble there on the battlefeld, as he was incessantly under
pressure. Suddenly he forced himself to greater efforts, swinging his club,

not parry it off.

The king of the monkeys was embarrassed, when he saw that his stepson

His brother, Nikumbha wanted to revenge him, dangerously brandishing a
mace. Like an eagle Pawanātmaja snatched the mace from his hand and
broke it into pieces.

But some of the leaders, who were also hunted, escaped by sly means and
were not killed.

His soldiers were ali courageous and ready to attack. Elephants, wagons,
and drivers were firm in performing their individual tasks without waiting
for orders as they were all experienced. They were always disciplined to be
successful in the battleñeld. Their bodies were full of scars, their beards
were dark and their feet were sturdy.

The strategy of their attack was that they attacked with missiles and formed
solid mobile units, attacking the rearguard or swinging [from the flanks] to
surprise the rearguard of the enemy. The monkey-army however was solid,
though they were scolded at or threatened, the monkeys kept fighting, they
escaped from the combined attack of the demons with inissiles and retaliated
in the hand to hand fight that ensued.

Soldiers with shield and swords came. They were experienced soldiers and
were never defeated. Their uniforms were brilliant and shining brightly,
ṭhe monkeys were dazzled when they looked at their glowing appearance.
It was as if they were really irresistible when they started to ñght at close

range-

Other units, armed with lances supported ṭhem in ñne arrangement. Dan-
gerously they placed their lances in front of their shields. The monkeys
were courageous and wild and agitated when the demons closed down on
them. They fell over and the demon units with the shields overwhelmed

them savagely.

The demon-units armed with shields were in high spirit and wanted to
defeat the monkeys, but they were battered with rocks. so that the shields
were broken by three and three. They were stabbed with trees, so that the
handles of their maces were broken. Many of them were battered by the
ṛocks, so that their ranks became shaky and broken.

The demons armed with clubs marched forward to relieve the units with
ṣhields, because they were exhausted. Those armed with missiles were
battering the monkeys incessantly. Shouting loudly those armed with
ṣwords charged at the dumfounded monkeys- Then the demons showered
the monkeys with salvoes of discs which were right on target.

The soldiers of Indrajit held their positions irmly for a long time. They
were eager to defeat the enemy and thrust forth forcefully. Prince Lakṣmaṇa
was his opponent to match their might, as they were experts in weaponry,
especially in the feld of ñre or water-arrows.

First the noble Lakṣmaṇa discharged a Baruṇa-arrow just to test [the power
of the enemy]. As if by magic the feld was turned into a sea with no
chance [for the enemy] to ward it off- The soldiers of Indrajit were in great
trouble, as they were on the verge of being drowned.

A brilliant shining ñre-arrow was Indrajit's answer to it. The arrow emitted
flaming fire which drove away the water. After the water was driven away,
the fre turned to attack, and because there was no wood, its attack could
not be repelled.

Then Indrajit released another arrow which issued all kinds of weapons,
namely the wcell-known usurāstra (demon-arrow) which brought forth swords,
hammers, axes, clubs, tridents in great columns, followed by *fre, all kinds
of missiles mixed with stones and billowing hot dust.

What type of arrow did he [Lakṣmaṇa] use for protection It was the
mahéśwaraśara (the arrow of god Mahéśwara) which consumed all kinds of
weapons shot at him. That was the arrow young Lakṣmaṇa used to ward
off the attack. Smashed and shattered, all the arrows of Indrajit dis-
appeared.

Because of exhaustion [Lakṣmaṇa] became impatient, as he was showered
with arrows for a long time. ‘I am ashamed, he said, ‘as in the past I was
very powerful. So he aimed at the elephants, wagon and driver of Indrajit,
and wiped them out completely. Only Indrajit was saved.

Some units remained and with them he [Indrajit] attempted an attack. He
had no wagon, no driver. he was alone fighting with all his might. So
[Lakṣmaṇa] shot at him with Indra and Rudra arrows which severed the
neck of the son of Daśawadana.

Also his seven wives followed him to death, fulñlling their vow to always be
faithful to their husband. The sages delightfully praised them when they
saw them committing sattee, a rain of cream and petals of owers fell down
intermittently, everywhere.

When Indrajit was slain, the hymn *Victory! Victory, was heard loudly in

a mighty enemy. The deities were delighted and full of praise, glowing with
happiness. They showered down sweet-smelling fragrant perfume [from the

Daśawadana at last was bereft of his protectors, very deep in grief. After
the death of his sons and attendants [he was] like a tree bereft of jts
branches. Although he was still alive it was very hard to stay that way,
as it was imminent that the woodcutter would chop off [the trunk].

It was unavoidable that he should enter combat and fight to the end. It was

stopped worrying and pulled himself together. He regained his spirits and
was not afraid anymore, in fact he was free and easy.

He went to pray and made offerings in the Śrwa-temple, and invoked the

brahmins were standing waiting reciting formulas which brought forth
calmness of mind and eternal Bliss in his undertaking.

The soldiers waited calmly for the marching out of king Daśawadana. All

Dust whirled up, and the battleñeld was in pitch darkness. They could
not see friend or foe, but they were mixed and confused. The order [of the
king] to his ministers was just to attack and kill, whoever it was, who came
their way. Whoever it was, once they met, one of them would be slain or
bereft of his dagger.

They were tumultous, shouting with their mouths wide open, parrying but
also falling into difñculties. There were demons whose necks were strangled

Others were screaming as they were knocked down on their heads with a

King Daśāsya was not surprised nor dejected, but he became angry and

a sharp lance, which he rotated violently. Sugrīiwa met him in combat, and
killed him easily with one blow.

When the three heroes, who looked exactly like Tripuruṣa incarnate

Again Daśāsya discharged an amazingly dangerous arrow, as from its point
burst forth hammers, tridents, swords, knives, rocks and wissiles which

When the arrows of Daśāsya were eliminated [by those of Rāma], the groups

Thus he said with conviction, and hurled his lance. It hit the noble

The wise and skilful Wibhīṣaṇa guickly picked up Lakṣmaṇa and brought
him behind the lines. He pulled out the lance as soon as he had the chance
and applied the cure by sprinkling [the water of the braṇitasandhim] until the
wound was healed. Lakṣmaṇa woke up and made his obeisance. Al]
who wailed stopped crying and laughed, the monkeys raised a thunderous
howl.

‘Ah, Mārutii How excellentt The wounded was cured by the herb you
obtained [from Himagiril. Your merits are indeed perfect and pure, worthy
to be taken as an example by those ruling over the people. Thus spoke the
monkey soldiers when they saw prince Lakṣmaṇa was well again. Rāma
embraced his younger brother, full of true affection and delight.

Daśamukha was at his wit's end, as he haḍ failed [to kill Lakṣmaṇa] and
returned home. He ordered another wagon with a powerful driver. Quickly
he mounted on to it. He wanted to kill or be killed in a short time. He
would not opt out for any of them. Thus he thought. His wagon
advanced with a crackling sound, agitating the heart of the hero, while the
horses sped forward neighing.

God Indra was doubtful in his heart, thinking that Rāma might be defeated
in battle. (Out of) concern he gave him the arrow Guhyawijaya and the
arrow of Brahmā together with a chariott. Nobody else but Mātali was
ordered to be the charioteer and to guard him. The son of Raghu and his
younger brother mounted the beautiful chariot bedecked with jewels.

Without delay the prince had already mounted the beautiful chariot given
by god Indra to him. The groups of sages in the sky expressed their
approval by showering down fragrant fowers. Daśānana saw this with
dismay, and it dawned to him that the prince would be victorious. He was
however unwavering and really courageous, so that he did not want to
acknowledge defeat and be unfair.

They came forward, exchanged salvoes of arrows to show their skill in all
weapons. First prince Raghuputra released a pāśupata-arrow, which emitted
snares and lances in great numbers. Daśāsya discharged the dragon-arrow,
which swallowed all the arrows of the prince. The prince shot forcefully
and speedily, so that the sky was flled up with them leaving no space.

Daśānana was hit, his head and chest were shattered and he fell unconscious.
His charioteer, seeing his master was hit, was terror stricken, and fed away
to save his life. He was really treacherous towards his master. Meanwhile
Daśamukha came to, and stood erect [in the chariot] to make his resistance.
His heart flled with horror, the driver climbed back in the wagon.

Rāwaṇa had a trident, a very powerful weapon, a grant of a deity to him.
He held it in his hand, it was shining and aming, as if emitting fre all the
time. Quickly Raghuputra rotated a lance, while reciting the indrakuliśa
(Indra’s thunderbolt) formula. They released their weapons at the same
time, [which clashed in the air] and were burnt to ashes.

Then they looked for other weapons, attacking each other with them, but
they were evenly matched. They had discharged the arrows of Yama,
Nairrĕta, Baruṇa, gukyaka (demi-gods), asura (demon), and secret arrows.
They used every weapon they could think of, but not one had success.
They were both extremely courageous, alert, dodging or parrying all
weapons coming to them and besides they were invulnerable.

When they came to closer range, they chased each other, struck and
stabbed at each other skilfully. They moved like wheels, in circles com-
peting in courage. They were separated for a moment, but without feeling
weary or slowing down they pounded at each other for a long time.
Their bodies seemed to be made of air, very thin and light as ifthey were
flying like the wind.

They were moving in circles like a spinning comet or like a broom which was
forcefully hurled around. They could not be seen, only the circle was seen
yery clearly rotating very fast, looking like the arena of god Yama and
Kālamrĕtyu when they were fighting, competing in might. Everyone
coming into the circle would certainly be killed, ground to dust by the
rolling wheels.

When they kept turning arourd, the ground shook as if on the verge of

The sun turned pale and dreary, the sea was billowing, swept along at all

In the sky the gaṇas (demi-gods) were holding on planets, apprehensive as
they attempted to watch over them, fearing that they would be thrown in
confusion as they saw the earth and the planets were drifting around. Not

Fragrant red lotuses were scattered nicely everywhere in the pond like the
embodiment of passion arousing pangs of love. Their leaves were broken
as they were so thin and transparent, because they were made of thin
plates of precious stone. Their pollen were granules of gold, yellowish
of colour spread over a court yard of gold. Only the aroma of ḍowers were
spreading everywhere, arousing the appetite of the bees (honey-collectors).

There on the fg-tree a bird stayed with her young ones in a nest of gold.
A pheasant with widespread wings and tail was displaying his beauty to a

aficted by teasing madness of love and also moved forward to meet a
parakeet which was beckoning to her, arousing madness in her.

When they moved to a guiet spot they gave free reign to their passion
while omitting amorous cries. They were not ashamed in front of a myna

deaf and dumb. But the parrot was unsatiable in her passion, she moved
forward to the myna bird with down-spread wings, expressing her desire.
The myna bird was filed with pity towards him as he waited upon her, and

God Bahni (Fire) in the form of an excellent human being came out and

Then god Agni addressed king Dāśarathi: O, prince Raghūttama, do not be
subdued by tamuh (ignorance). What is the reason that you are doubtful
about the purity of your wife. Your heart is like that of a child, confused
and full of misconception.

elephants and horses. The outstanding prime minister Sumantrī gave the
order to everyone to line up at the main highway. The leaders of the
villagers came forward to pay their humble obeisance to the king, together
with offerings of cooked and uncooked food, e.g. fruits, water buffaloes, ñsh,
meat of deer etc to prepare empal-empalan (a kind of meat dish, boiled or
fried) with all kinds of spices.

The spokesmen told them to line up and carry the things they wanted
to offer, cakes and dishes of all kinds of bee-larvae, nobody came empty
handed. Ahter they had handed over their offerings, they sat at the side of
the road to see the king pass by. At that moment the prime minister
ordered them to sit ive by fve along the road, so that the road was clear,
like the mind of the people, free from disappointment, the gustis (waiṭyas)
were not offended and the brakmins were also given respect accordingly.

Along the way home, the road was decorated with banners and
hangings. The king and the queen, under one umbrella walked together,
talking and laughing, discharging all feelings of longing. The multitude
was tumultuous, they jostled one another, they were affected by the sight of
the king and gueen loving each other. Some were offering garlands which
could not be forwarded as they were pushed from behind. They turned
angrily to those pushing them asked to stop, but in vain. Others were
looking at one another, very much in love and were turned on when they
were pinched and poked, their breasts molested.

Bharata was behind, slightly embarrassed to see his beloved brother
with his wife walking in front, laughing and talking to make everyone happy.
But his brother, seeing him in the rear called him and took his hands, as he
felt his longing for him had not been abated. And the presents were so
many, dresses and ornaments were distributed to the monkeys.

Many monkeys were fighting for sugar cane which they swung slightly
before breaking it [on their knees]. They walked buoyantly, drank coconut
milk to their ñll along the road. They scraped out the flesh and ate it,
while some of its juice fell on their breasts making it wet. Then the fruit of
the ṭal-tree were served, after being duly prepared. Thus were the presents
of the royal couple to them. The monkeys were a bit embarrassing,
because they were by nature agile and playful. That was what they did
along the way.

When they arrived at the periphery of the capital city, the king ordered
ṭhat the monkeys be given presents in order to gain the sympathy of the
people who came to mect and to see them. Groups of on-lookers were
ṣtretching up to see the monkeys (the inhabitants of the woods) and the
beautiful decorations dangling on the music horns, which sounded so
merry. They talked to one another discussing the one who was designed
to rule the world, following his success in his work elsewhere, and that was
now coming.

Bharata approached to relicve Lakṣmaṇa, in turn Lakṣmaṇa relieved
Mainda in carrying the attributes. Śatrughna became his counter-parts
whun he took the place of Nala, carrying the golden umbrella above the
head of the king. The four of them looked perfect, looking like beautiful
trees, giving shelter to the world by means of the four ways, sāmu (scttle-
ment), dāna (compcnsation), daṇḍa (force) and bkéda (sowing dissension).

When they were already well arranged in the palace, the priests and
the religious teachers came happily to welcome them with everything for
the ceremony of welcome, to create a peaceful atmosphere. The dancers
were staging a performance, others were singing the tunes while another
group was playing the gamĕlan which sounded sweet and captivating. The

.dancers performed a war-dance, both stood and walked around, rising and

swooping, moving swiftly with full force attacking one another, whilst the
kaṅsi was followed by lively baṇḍuṅ and flutes.

The extremely beautiful and level royal sguare was strewn with gold
and precious stones of all colours. The great audience hall was marvellously
decorated with gold, silver, jewels, and hangings of pearls. The eves were
hung with clothes, red-and-white-coloured, red from sindāra and white from
the sap of durgy (which is yellowish white of colour). There were also black
camara-fans which looked like the mustache of the audience hall and other
decorations were paper lanterns, taṅluṅ, kya-kya fruit and yellow coconuts,
varying one another in colour and lustre. Everybody was amazed at the
sight of all the decorations, even more so when they saw the king sitting on
his throne, studded with greṇt stones shining brilliantly.

The king and gueen arrived and sat on the thrones. The guests, the
famous king of Lĕṅkā and the king of the monkeys were also sitting on
jewelled thrones, followed by the son of Kekayī, Somitra, and Śatrughna.
They took garlands and wore them, and took a bit of all food and drinks
that were served, e.g. meat and fsh from the wood and ocean. Oh, it was
too much to be described what had gone on in the golden hall.

The monkeys at the north royal sḍuare were also served, under the

by the king to eat everything in the food boxes together with drinks of all
kinds, until the monkeys became drunk, and their faces were red, and still
the drinks were not yet fnished.

The ears of the king of the monkeys were red-coloured, as the four of
them were affected by liḍuor. The monkeys, overwhelmed by the power of
liguor stood up, and made their obeisance with a toast which was accepted
and followed by others. Then they sang about the defeat of Rāwaṇa with
a good voice, accompanied by flutes and other instruments which gave
enjoyment and merriment to the monkeys, as they were fond of music.

King Ragūttama ate together with the gueen to their perfect satis-
faction of everything served which was freshly prepared. Then the betel
box was served with all the ingredients and instruments, alternated with
drinks and other food, variously prepared with different favours which
made the body warm and sweating caused by the liguor. Then those
ṣerving the body-cream, made of curcuma and cool sandal-wood mixture
came forward and applied it to the breast, shoulders and neck, and the re-
freshing effect penetrated into the heart. The camara-fans gave a sof and
ṣweet breeze which made their hearts happy. When they wanted to wear
fowers, there was a collection of lotuses, campakas, bolus, gaḍuṅs, pandanus,
and the aromatic utkalas. Then they went out to the royal square, followed
by the younger brothers and the virtuous guests. Prince Bharata came to
the guests and stood amongst the monkeys, who were eating and drinking.
here was a crippled attendant of the court called Baṇḍira who came to
prince Bharata and joined him to welcome the guests with information and
reuests to the guests :

Comc forward and help yourself. Ifyou want a dish of blood, please wait

do not worry about getting drunk. There are eggs, please help yourself

thing that is taken care of by the handy cook who prepares the tasty things
which has given him a reputation of a clever cook. If it were not so, he
could not be accepted here, and would be dismissed. That is why he is
afraid of doing something wrong. Now, the dishes of lobsters should be
described. Before it is cooked, it is cut into pieces and quickly put onto
skewers and the white fesh is then roasted, and it will not be served before
it is turned over and over. The liver of the shark and the hkawulu-ksh is
cooked, wrapped in banana-leaves. For those who want great strength the
meat of the following animals is recommmended, e.g. rabbits, wild-hen, all
of them taste good. Not to mention the good meat described in the cook-
book which includes black sheep, lizards ofall kinds, wild pigeons, rice-birds
and also uails.

Wait for the dishes prepared from the meat of porcupines which is in
the same group with ant-eaters. [Hey boys,] bring forward everything
uickly, leave for awhile that which is not yet prepared. Bring forward
and serve them to the monkey heroes. Satisfy their appetite. [And you,
my dear guests] when you have almost finished your plate, you may come
ṭo the kitchen, and take another plate, as big as a winnow, and ñll it up with
pork and crisps, steamed arrowroot. Behold how a warawan-dish is prepared.
Take the sting out of a big wood-scorpion, because it is wellknown to the
world, that the scorpion has a superb taste. The taste of the meat of a flying
fox is strongly aromatic, fatty, stiff and tough and sticky. You must chew
iṭ well frst, then swallow, because if you are not lucky, your throat may be
affected. The tuliriṅ and shell-fsh should be prepared carefully, as the cook
will be ashamed if they do not taste well. Take a taste also of the dishes
of turtle-meat, all kinds of lawar (dishes prepared of blood), all kinds of
meat-soups, meat prepared in bamboo, all kinds of p¥ṅs, all kinds of sour
dishes, all kinds of dishes in coconut-leaves boxes, all kinds of sarads, steamed
vegetables, all kinds of dishes prepared in hot ashes; the mince-meat mixed
with vegetables, pure vegetable salads. Put a drop of lemon juice [when
eating them]. Ask for rice at will. Ifyou want to drink water, suit your-
self, but there are also honey, strong roe of ñsh, aromatic coconut cream,
and palmwine. There are also sweetmeats, jackfruit, salad, not to
mention buttercakes, crisps and unegualled sesame-perfume. Please have

There are various kinds of ne snacks consisting of roasted nuts and
beans. If you want to eat them, peel them off ñrst, but take it by the
handful as guickly as possible. If you drink cold water, do not wet yourself.
Then you can eat tuber, jackfruit, yellow bananas, excellent sweet saluks,
and drink it with sugarcane juice. The youths should drink benehcial milk-
shakes, do not suck the sweet and delicious jukut, and do not miss the
delicious lśpêt wrapped in banana-leaves, and looks whitish. What will
follow is the ultimate of delicacies. It is cooked in coconut cream and looks
tough but smooth (sweet cake). That sticky one is made of glutinous rice
with a little curcuma. Now, look at that one rising up between the others.
They are so eager to imitate the drummer and brandishing a club, like
people fighting with clubs, gleaming brilliantly like a man cooking oil in a
vessel, and the firewood is sizzling and clattering like shots [from guns], very
frightening. By fours they go into the oil intoxicated but bravely fighting.
The bubur susu śuddha (milk-porridge of perfection, a kind of dessert) is not
yet cooked, as it is eaten only after the minds are sobering aker intoxication,
afected by the fighting with drink-bottles (caused by liberal drinking).
However, the flowers are ready. What is the signiñcance of all these enjoy-
ments è 1It is the ruit reaped by the victorious hero. He will ind fame,
great wealth, but most of all he should be thankful always to god
Mahéśwara, the origin of all happiness and cternal peace in the world.]

They stayed in bed like a couple of ascetics. Affected by heat they took
the clothes off. They were absorbed in meditation, contemplating on the
essence of the Supreme Truth. They performed the worship of the secret

They were in full concentration when the phallus reached the wulva, filling

and again until they were satisñed.

The feeling of one who has been separated from his spouse and then re-
united, is different to that of one who has just obtained a lover. Desire,
love and passion are combined with the sweet memories of the past. This
gives the special feelings in the minds of those reunited.

Only they could feel the ecstasy. I could not. Please forgive me for being

Waātsyāyana and the secret handbooks. If you have studied those scriptures,
you will be able to experience that ecstasy.

Let us not further discuss the supreme delights. When it was day again,
the guests were given more entertainments. For five, six, seven days, they
did not stop drinking. Until eight, nine [days], and on the tenth day the
party was over.

Both the guests delightedly asked consent to leave, to return to their res-
pective lands carrying all the presents granted by the king, e.g. elephants,
wagons, horses, women, slaves and local female slaves. They had accepted
all the valuable gifts of the king.

Also Trijaṭā came forward to make her obeisance to the king before her

The gueen loved her very much and gave her presents of ine clothes and
jewels, all of outstanding quality, together with women-in-waiting, gold and

The nature of Rāma in fullling his religious duties for the whole world is
exactly like Manmatha, the god of Love in fulñlling his duties concerning
sensorial pleasures. Therefore may the story of Rāma, which contains ex-
cellent words [of guidance] be like fragrance that penetrates into the hearts
[of men]. The great yogins will become profcient [in the Wêdas], the good
people will obtain a pure mind after reading it. Ifit is read to unfortunate
people, be he low or high in rank they will understand it beyond doubt,
which will ultimately lead them to heavenly Bliss.

III. NOTES ON THE TRANSLATION OF THE RK.

The numbers found before words or phrases noted denote the number
of the sarga and stanza, whilst the letters a.b.c.d. refer to the lines in the
stanza.

I.l5c-d: kadi pwa Gaṅgā saka Himawāmn, rupa nya katon sutéjaśr1

([The pavilion looked like] the goddess Ganga [descending] from the
Himalayas, radiating splendour). Kīs translation uertoonden āij īich in de vorm
wan den Ganges die van den Himālaya nederdualt (they appeared in the form of the
river Ganges which descended from the Himalayas) is certainly infuenced by
the story of king Bhagīratha bringing the river Gaṅgā down to earth (See
HPS.I.73-98, also HZ, p. 110-21). In the story it is mentioned that king
Bhagīratha riding on his chariot is followed by the river, but in a relief of the
VII century AD at Māmallapuram, of the descent of Gaṅgā from heaven to
earth (See HPS.I.112 and the picture numbered as no 27 and 28), Gaṅgā is
depicted as a celestial nymph fiying behind king Bhagiratha. While there is
nothing wrong with the translation of Kern, I cannot agree with him that the
lookout pavilion can be compared with the river Gaṅgā, as his translation
suggests, *falling down from heaven>. 1 rather believe that Gaṅgā should take
the form of a heavenly nymph. Hence my translation.

I.3labcd. My translation is very different to that of Kern. Hooykaas,
based on a letter of W. Bhadra (See V.K.I.16/1955-21) comments on K’s trans-
lation and gives another translation, which gives me the impression that CH has
not fully understood W. Bhadra’s letter, as his translation does not reflect the
practice in Bali or the belief among the Javanese people, as can beseen in my
translation. It is not the sage or the seers who eat the offering rice but the
ḍueers, as it is believed to contain benevolent power.

I44abcd. K. renders line cd into opdat ik de reuṛen die my hinderen, dooden
kunwe (so that I could kill the demons who disturbed me). My translation is
slightly different to K's, as one should note that Wiśwāmitra. being a sage, does
not wish to take judgement into his own hands and kill the demons himself
See e.g. ādiparwa, the story of the sage Uttaṅka who wants to avenge the trick
played upon him by the dragon Takṣaka. Takṣaka has stolen a kuṇḍalamaṇi
from Uttaṅka, who wants to present it to his teacher’s wife as fee for his
education. Uttaṅka as a sage cannot take the law into his own hands and comes
730

to king Janamejaya, urging him to perform the snake-offering, in order to kill
Takṣaka. Uttaṅka tells king Janamejaya that Takṣaka has killed the father of
the king. So Takṣaka in fact has sinned many times, once against a sage
(Uttaṅka), and another time against the king (Janamejaya). Then Uttaṅka
says further :

Ndu tan sṇogya wwaṅ wiku magawaya daṇḍa, mataṅ yan hśn¥ṅ ra byjaṅga haji.
Kunaṅ śrī mahārāja yogya magawaya daṇḍn, apan dharma niṅ kadi kita, ksatrṇṣa, ikan
dum¥ṇḍa yukti dĕwan. (But I am a sage and it is not proper for a sage to punish
people, therefore I keep guiet. However, Your Majesty has the right togive
punishment, because the dkarma of a kṣatrṇa (warrior caste) is to punish people
who deserves to be punished). Hence my translation of the above stanza. It
underlines the fact, that Rāma is only a means for the brahmin to kill the
demons. This is acknowledged by Rāma himself in II.31 which reads: *At
your service, O, great sage. Do not worry, because the power of your
asceticism is enormous and cannot be surpassed. That will make us victorious
over your enemies>.

Thus, it is not the power of Rāma that destroys the demons, but the
priest’s. This kind of belief is mentioned again later, this time it is said that
Rāma is only an instrument of the gods and sages to destroy the demon-race
and the kingdom of Lĕṅkā.

Sumali, the grandfather of Rāwaṇa, giving advice to Rāwaṇa says in
XIV.5:

Mdan saṅsṇuṅkwi rasikāpi upaya niṅ kyaṅ,
mwaṅ saṅ watpk rśsi kabth magawé upaya,
wwaṅ saktimanta ginawé nira karaṇa niṅ,
Lśṅkāpura pralgya rakṣasa tan paśiṣā.

(Then I suspect him of being the instrument of the deities and the sages.
They created a mortal, a powerful human being, as a means to destroy the city
of Lĕṅkā together with the entire demon race). In the ādiparwa, it is said that
Garuḍa came into existence as a result of an offering performed by the
sixty thousands Wālakhilyas to avenge their grievance against god Indra.

-
 The text is derived from P. Zoetmulder, Sekar-Sumawwr, I p. 103, but the spelling and
translation are my own.
731

I.55d byakta kami kahék śināpa nira (Surely he will curse all of usl. The
king has every reason to fear the sage Wiśwāmitra, as he is known to be very
short-tempered, but exceedingly powerkul. See e.g. W.D. Monro, Stories of Indian
Gods Heroes, p. 1-43. especially those parts concerning his feud with the sage
Wasiṣṭha, in which Wiśwāmitra’s temperament is described clearly. Monroés
story is apparently based on the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmiki (See HPS.I.101-125).
This story is also known in the Oldjavanese literature e.g. ādiparwa.

I.56d yan yogya pwa ṅhulun śaraṇā (if [you think] I am good enough to be
your protector, [I do not mind)). This line is ambiguous. Daśaratha is trying
to offer himself to fight the enemies of the sage, to save Rāma, because in his
eyes Rāma is still too young and inexperienced etc. But obviously the sage does
not want to understand the hint. This ambiguity is not traceable in K’s trans-
lation. Likewise in Leonardis translation of the Bhaṭṭikāwya (see p. 5), but
in the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki (see HPS.I.42) it is very clear and seems to be
very close to the RK.

II.la śaratsamaya (autumn). 1In the RK it is understood that śaratsamṇya
is the end of the rainy season, e.g. in VIL.32 it is said :

tĕkāṅ śaratkāla wèh wiśuddha malilaṅ loṅit

(the dry season had come. The sky was pure and clear)
] translate sératkāla here with dry season, because in VII.34c Rāma said
as follows : awīs ya iki lahru liṅtku samayanta yékin téka (clearly the dry season has
come, the time agreed upon). The agreement mentioned here is the agreement
with Sugrīwa, who was to assist Rāma to search for Sītā. RK relates the agree-
ment as follows : sāmpun samgyālūt rĕṅ-réṅ ya ta h¥rśn, Sugrwa manĕmbah mamwita
misātā (after they agreed to wait for [the end of] the rainy season, Sugrīwa took
his leave to return to his palace). So it is obvious here that sdratkālu or
sśratsamaya is synonymous with lakru (dry-season) and opposed to rĕṅ-rĕṅ (rainy-
season).

Iī.9c caṇḍalu *damned\ (a curse). K’s translation suggests clearly that
the Caṇḍālas he mentions there, are the hunters. It seems that this was also the
opinion of Leonardi. In my article “The word taji in the Rāmāyaṇa Kakawin,”
] argue that caṇḍālu in this stanza is an exclamation of the deer which is on the
verge of drowsing off, due to the lullaby of the bees, but is awakened with a
start by the repeated pining of the geese.
732

I1.22c wijagaātidujaya jayā wjjayā jayanṅ. K. remarks that these formulas
are not found in the Skt. sources. but does not mention the sources. The BK
mentions only Jaya and Wijaya. The Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki apparently does
not mention the two formulas but gives a list of divine weapons including the
formulas to discharge and to withdraw them (see HPS.I.59-62). Even though,
J suspect that the above line is a part of the words of Wiśwāmitra which are

ṭranslated as follows : **O Prince, mayest thou be triumphant............ , or a
paraphrase of it.

I1.62b dharmārtha kāma gawayĕn tuwi dé naréndra [Dharma (religious acts)
artha (gathering worldly wealth) and kāwu (striving for sexual fulñlment for pro-
geniture), should be carried out also by a ,ṣakrṇa (warrior caste)]. Kos trans-
lation and notes are different to mine, as I understand that a member of the
4rṅwaṅśa should strive for the fulñlment of these matters, when passing through
the 4 stages (caturāśrama) of life.

I.64abcd. The arrangement of the lines in the stanza leads K astray.
]t is customary that the bride and groom pay their obeisance to their parents.
Another ceremony in which the bride makes obeisance to the groom seems not
to be narrated here. This kind of ceremony of marriage can still be seen on the
stage of the wṇyarg orarg in Central Java. In this kind of scene usually the father
of the bride performs the ceremony. The groom has to say : ‘Bapa, aku anyju
(Father, I choose [such and so as bride])". The bride hasto say : c‘Bapa, aku
katyju (Father, I am chosen [by such and so as bride])?. Then the father will
declare them husband and wife. In the kraton of Surakarta, it is still customary
ṭhat after the wedding ceremony, whether it is directly or indirectly, the king
who gives away the princess, will say to the groom : */ṅsun tarimakaké putra
putri niñsun,............ maraṅ pakĕnira. Iṅ tĕmbé buri yên wis ora pakĕnira kaṅgokaké,
pak¥nira konduraké maraṅ pura.> (īI bestow upon you my daughter........ .Later
when you no longer want her as your wife, return her to the palace).

I1.76abcd. I cannot understand K's remark in which he says that the
Javanese author misunderstood the Skt. original. Even his translation makes
clear that prince Rāma is asked by Paraśurāma to shoot his abode in heaven
reserved by Indra, so that he (Paraśurāma) cannot go there. This means that
Paraśurāma went to South India (according to K). Leonardi who translates the
Śkt. original of the RK, the Bhaṭṭikāvya, does not mention where Paraśurāma
has gone, exactly as the author of the RK. The Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmiki mentions
ṭhat Paraśurāma went to the Mahéndra mountain. This is perhaps the place, K
733

refers to as South India. Concerning the reason why Paraśurāma asked Rāghawa
to destroy the place in heaven reserved for him by Indra, the Agastyaparwa
accounts as follows : *‘that place in heaven is the result of the wiśwgjitygjña
performed by Rāmaparaśu after he defeated the kings who had killed his father,
mother and brothers. It seems that Rāmaparaśu has a much higher ideal to
strive for, namely the ṣoḍaśatattwa, and Indra’s heaven forms a handicap for
him.2 So, according to the Agastyaparwa, the destruction of his place in
Indra’s heaven is a kind of blessing in disguise. Further read J. Gonda: The
Agastyaparwa, text in BKL. 90(1933).384-5 and translation in Bk7, 94(1936).

III.l2a wruké lor kidul (to know which is north and which is south).
Though I translate the phrase literally, the reader must be aware that the
phrase in fact means, everything or everywhere. This phrase can be found
many times in the RK. See about lor kidul, the article of W. Aichele in BX7.
115(1959).

III.l8a lawan saṅ apatih Sumantri marahup sir¥ṅ lwah magöṅ.

(Likewise p.m. Sumantri. He washed his face in a big river). The
episode of a prime minister washing his face in the river on his way back from
the woods to the capital city is also found in the Babad Tanah Jawi, the episode
of Ajar Cepaka/Ciuṅ Wanara, which in fact is blended together with the story
of the Yadus in the Mausalaparwa. The BTJ of Meinsma does not mention this
part of the story, but the Babad Galuh Mataram does. 1I think the story
of Ciun Wanara being floated into the river, aker the failure to kill him
by poison etc. resemble that of Sītā in other versions of the Rāma-story.

ITI.23b sulur usĕr lawan candana. In several places in the RK we see
the use of canduna (sandalwood) in the form of paste or ointment as a cure for
fever caused by pangs of separation. In the third chapter we see that king
Daśaratha fell ill because Rāma had gone to the forests. All treatment with
sandalwood ointment and other medicine failed and at last he died. In the
eighth sarga princess Sītā lamented that the fever that overcame her, because of
her separation with her husband, was so serious that even candana paste made
by Trijaṭā could not reduce the pain. It is evident that this kind of thing is
also found in other stories. For further readings see The Ocean 9f Stoṇ, VIl.
105-7.

ITīI60c yatnā ṇyan pamati-mati. (īt is the selective character [of the lion]
when killing, that should be taken as an example [by a great hero]). I render
yatnā with selwckiye, whilst K appears to ignore it, even adding (alle vjjanden-all
enemies) to his translation. I prefer to think that the writer of the RK through
Rāma wants to stress that, unless it is necessary, a lion will not kill his enemy.
This indeed is true and worth to be taken as example by a hero, he should not
just kill the enemies, because they are enemies. As an illustration [ may put
forward Sīā’s remark to Hanūmān, when the latter wants to kill the she-
demons who have threatened to kill her and tormoented her, in sarga XX1IV.133,
as follows: **Besides, what is the use of killing powerless women. Only dan-
gerous and powerful enemies should be worthy of being killed by you.”

Iīī.6ld ,ékā praśraya sumuka (humbleness is preferable). K renders this
line with dat is minṛame wellewendheid (that is affable politencss). K renders Jékū
with dut is (that is) causes the difference with my translation as I regard yékā
only as an emphatic word. I regard praśraya as derived from pra-śrṭ (humble-
ness), based on M.D. p. 321. Hence my translation.

ITī8ln panas iṅ pāśa pahasat (dry up the heat of the snarc). K seems to
be in doubt concerning his translation. I think this phrase comes into NJ. in
a somewhat corrupted form, namely wêsi-hasat or wĕṇasat. G. & R. II.44 says
that it might be derived from uisiyasat and gives a cross-reference to siuwul on
I.854 this gives as explanation strafe behundeling, kastijding, tuchtiging etc., which
fits the context of the Rāmāyana. The word wḍsigsut is still freuently heard in
the story of the dalaṅ of the shadowplay when he relates the virtues of the king
in the frst scene of his performance.

IV.8b suku (leg). K renders it with woeten (feet) and remarks that it js
impossible for Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to reach them, as the demon Wirādha is
said to walk on his hands. 1I think K forgets that in Oldjavancse as well as in
N.]J. the word suku means fwt as well as lyg.

IV.15b wanawāsakgtith ya. This is one of the so many phrases which
I amend from K’s reading which reads waṅ anatu katitht ya. The reading of the
other mss can be consulted in the text. I think my reading is more appropriate
and fits the context very well. In HPS II.15-7 it is related that Rīma, Sītā
and Lakṣmaṇa came to the hermitage of the sage Sutīkṣṇa together with other
hermits. So it is possible also that the word wanawā@saku refers to the sages
accompanying Rāma.
735

IV.18abcd. K(s translation does not give any relationship between
Rāma’s killing of deer and his religious duties. Vaidya in his book 7ṅe Riddle
ṭf the Rāmāyaṇu states that the hunting and killing of deer and offering its flesh
to hermits originated from pre-vedic periods.

IV.21ab sira tāpasawéṣa yan katon, ndan ikā@ṅ gyudha yéka tan kasah (he looked
like an ascetic, but he was never separated from his weapons). Doing
penance, while not separated from weapons becomes the subject of a lively
debate in the Arjunawiwāha, between Indra and Arjuna, the more so in the N].
wagyaṅ lakon (shadowplay story) Mintaraga. See Dr. R. Ng. Poerbatjaraka
(Lesya), Arjuna-Wiwaha, chapter V-VJ, in B. L 82(1926)199-202.

īV.40b. I amend the reading of all mss including K's from athawūtaṅ etc.,
into adhawātah. With the original reading, the sentence seems to become non-
sense, while with adhawā (Skt. M.W.p.20 one who has no husband, widow), it is more
appropriate. So here we have the contrast between a virgin (rara. dara, B.ī.)
and a widow (a woman with an experience in sexual intercourse). In B.I. such
a virgin is called bagai gadis jolok bersubang (a girl who is so eager to marry). K's
faulty reading of the word diṇḍaré which he analyses as di-n-ḍaré (raré) leads him
into trouble. The derivation should be: diṇ ( <riṅ) and ḍaré (<rara-i). Leonardi>s
translation gives no clue.

IV.55 tinéw¥r nira nasika niké. This motive of nose-cutting of an adul-
terous wife, as Śūrpaṇakhā; is already married, is also found in the story
of the Brahman Agniśarman and his wicked wife. See Tâe Ocewn of stwṇ IX.
75-6.

IV.68b kami kāliṅta. K renders the word kalih with beide (both) which
is not appropriate as there are three demons, Khara, Triśirah and Dūṣaṇa. So
[ think kami kalikta should be kami sekalian in B.I. and should be rendered as all
gf us in English.

īV.76d tuwi bala rākṣasa tan wênaṅ mulat ya (even the demon soldiers were
afraid to look at it). K renders it with zij konden ’t leger der reuṣen niet aanīien
(they could not bear the sight of the demon-army). So instead of regarding bala
yākṣasa (the demon-soldiers) as the subject of the sentence as I do. K regards it
as the object 1I think the sages could not bear the sight of the
dead body of Triśirah without his three heads, as even the demon-soldiers were
afraid of it.
736

V.6d prakāśita Rāma Lakṣmaṇa mal ya taman pamalśs. K renders it with
zij sneuyelden āonder gewroken te worden (they were killed without being avenged).
The literal translation should be tke well-known Rāma and Lakṣmaya killed them [and]
thg were not able to render any harm. In my view Śūrpaṇakhī is only reporting the
facts, which is also apparent in stanza 10.

V.8ĕb tat [t] aṅĕn-aṅĕn ṅ awasāna pṛêr. K s translation reads denkt gij niel
aan het einde (you do not think about the end). So awasānu is rendered by K with
het einde (the end). I am of the opinion that ṅ awasāna here means “Uṅings to come
later or>, which I render with *tke future> in my translation.

V.26c waṅul. K thinks that it is the same word as in Tag. bangal
(dom = stupid). I think the Indonesian word b¥ngal (bold, stubborn) is more

appropriate here.

V.28d gamaunantu. K renders the word gamananta with hoe dan ṛult gjj
ket aanleggen (how would you take up with......... ). I assume that gamanantu is
derived from gaman (weapon) -a (arealis) -nta (your), so that it should be rendered
with ‘“what should be your weapon’.

V.33d ṅika umgwt ya tambayan atah lalu hu duhut. K renders tambgyan
with 2oo dudelḍjk (so guick) which is uite incorrect as apparent in his translation
which reads dat kj dien al āoo dadeljjk spande wus iets ṭeer gering (that he the bow
so uickly drew was something very insignificant) In my view the literally
translation should read *those drawing the bow before him were very weak.
Hence my translation.

V.59a yan alalisāṅ bhalāra pĕjuhāélu siraṅ siniwi. K seems to regard
bhalra as God, because he renders the line with indien de godheid ṛvo onbarmhartig
mocht weṛen dat hij, de geeerbiedigde, gedoud is. ........ (if God is so merciless that he,
the worshipful one is killed......... ). In fact Sītā talked about Rāma, whom she
indicated as Lord (Bhaṭāra) and muster (saṅ siniwi). Hence my translation into
*if my lord and master died”.........

V.blc naya nira. K seems to assume that nira here refers to Sīā,
but I think it is more appropriate that it refers to Lakṣmaṇa, as the whole stanZa
speaks about Lakṣmaṇa.

V.68-VL6. The rape of Sītm is a dramatic replica of the story of Rāwaṇa
with Wédawatī in the Uttarakāṇḍa (See HPS. I11.420-3).
737

V.74c hana to hṇu nya mātra kawĕkas ya paḍania katon. K’s rendering
reads er bestuut slechts Uw schoon, Uws gelijke blṭ ft achter U (there is only your
beauty; your eual is far behind you). Though K explains the last part with
is yer te ṛoeken (is very diffcult to ñnd), to me it is still very hard to follow. The
text has 7ṇa and ya (third pers. sing. or plur.), but there is no trace of it or it is
replaced by your (second pers. sing. or plur). In my view ṇya and yu refers to
sśkar (fower) in line a. Therefore my translation is as follows: *there are still
traces of its beauty apparent. You are like that>. Teeuw renders the frst part
with ṛodut de schoonheid enkel is oergeblewen (so that only the beauty is lef) which
shows much similarities with mine, but the idea is uite diferent.

V.76d pira warśga 1ya riṅ wiṣgya matta bkaṭāra tuwi. K and Teeuwīs
translations are almost identical, perhaps Teeuws is easier to follow. Itseems
that with the word nya, K and Teeuw understand the taruṇa (youths). In my
view the word nya refers to bkatūra in the same line. It should be remembered
that it is spoken by Rāwaṇa who has no regard at all for the deities. For com-
parison I note down the translations:

K: Hoe weinig 2ouden zjj zich verāadigen aan het sinnelijk genotl kelfs de goden
gśjn (als) dol.
T(eeuw): Hoe weinig ṛouden e van tingenot verāadigd worden, waur zelfs de goden dbl
gḍśjn.
S. However satiated deities are with sensual pleasures, they too would
be infatuated with you.

V.77ab hana daridra duhkkita tuwin mari yan pahṇun, yan apa ya tāsihérja
sumaṇḍiṅa yê śgyana. Ks and TīUs translations are identical in idea, the
difference lies in the usage of words and structure of the sentences which make
's ṭranslation more readable. It seems that here both scholars assume that
RZwaṇa describes himself to Śītā as the urme stakker enī (poor man etc.) The
only fault is that they disregard the word tuwi-n (even) with the result that they
have to regard saṅ wiṣgṇ in line c as the same man as de arme stakker in line a.
In my view, in stanza 76 the poet compares a youth who is still longing for love,
with deities who have no trouble at all in satisfying their need for sensoral
pleasures. In stanza 77 the picture drawn by the poet is much stronger,
here he talks about an ascetic who suppressed his senses (paācéndriva and
paācawiṣaya) and one who is still deeply inuenced by them. Below are the tran-
slations of the two lines:

K: Er is en arme, ongelukkige, die opgehouden heeft minneweelde te smaken, daar
738

hij geen liṭfje hegfī om nuust hem in bed te liggen
ī: Eyr is een arme stakker, wien liṭfies vreugd geuloden is, daar hij geen liṭf meer
heṭfi, dut īijn leger wil delen.

S: Even an extremely poor ascetic who has overcome his sensual im-
pulses, why should he not be passionate if you are by his side in
bed.

That an ascetic is said to be a very poor man is stated many times in the
RK, eg. in I137d: tan dréwa saṅ wiku ṅaranwa attaduhkha (the hermits do
not have wealth, they are very poor). Almost the same words are used in both

passages.

V.83d kita kadi mola mĕṅg¥p amêpiri siraṅ siniwi. I assume that molha
is derived from mu-uli (beautiful, uneualled) -a (arealis) and means tke beautiful
one, the unegualled one, the most reverent one. The Indonesian word is mulia. I can-
not understand why K renders this word with den domme (the ignoramus).
T, though seemingly reluctant, follows K’s steps. The translations are as
follows :
K: Het is alsṇf Gij U van den domme wilt houden, den schijn aanneemt van uit te

worschen wie mijn gemaal is.
T: Alsof gij nergens iets van wisl, veinst gij te uragen naar mijn heer.
S: You seem to be a reverent [ascetic] who wants to see my husband.

Vl.4a awakla yékā hyasi wêkśn adyana. For once T departs from K's
translation, and in my opinion, arrives at a wrong path. It seems he assumes
that the word adi is synonymous with kuyu and renders it with goedkeuren (to
agree with). Partly his assumption is correct, in that is, a4 is synonymous to
kgu, but the meaning in this context should be to beautjfṣ. The translations are
as follows :

K: 7uoi Uw lichaam, laat het versierd worden.

T: īooi nu uw lichaam, āuṣjr, en will mijn plan goedkeuren.

S: Dress up and make yourself beautiful.

Vl7cd asiṅ pakon tar dadi laṅghanā atah, waliṅku sihtéryaku. Without
taking the whole lamentation of Sītā into account, a translator might get lost
here. K and T seem to think that pakon (order) is Rāma's, perhaps in the
meaning that it is improper for Sītā to give orders to Rāma, but they forget
that the same word, pakon (order), is used in stanza 11b, which undoubtedly
must be ascribed to Sītā, as it reads sapakonku tar wihaṅ (he never opposed what
739

J asked) The translations are as follows :
K: Alwat Gij bewault heb ik toch niet overschreden, ik denk dat Uwe liefde voor

mj.........

T: Al wat gy mj bewaalt heb ik toch nimmer overschreden\ Ik dacht dat gij van
mij hield.........

S. You never opposed what I reuested. I thought it was out of love
for me.

V].12ab piré kadhrān ira saṅ maharddhika, r¥ṅĕ wuwus niṅ kala mur atah sira.
K and T are deluded by their perception of the phrase wuwus niṅ kala, which K
yenders with de kreten van den reus (the cries of the demon) and T with ket woord
der reugen (the word of the demonsṣ). They might be inñuenced by the acts of
Mgāmrīca, but in fact wuwus niṅ kala literally means the words yf an evil person or
wil words, harsh words, rude words. The tṭranslations are as follows:
K: Hoe kliinmoedig was de (gewaande) geestebjjke, bij *4 hooren yan de kreten van
den reus ṭjlde hij weg
T. Hoe moedig was toch de machtigel Op het horen van het woord der reuāen
śjlde hjj weg
S: How constant is the mind of a noble-minded man p When he receives
rude words, he just leaves.

VI.l8ab Jaṭ@wu yéki ta bhalāra Bhuskara, umaṭanaṅ mārkkha kakdéh tamomgya.
The variation in translation here is interesting to note. It seems so trivial, but
reflects the different approach and way of reading of the translators. The trans-
lations are as follows:
K: Jatāu hiw is (als) de āonnegod, die alle yerwaande duisterlingen zal dooden;
T: Jaṭāyu hier is als de Zonnegod, die alle verdwoausde āonen der duisternis doden
gal.
Ṣ. This is Jaṭāyu. 1I will destroy the outrageous ones like the Sungod
destroys darkness.
y©.3śb kakāsih. I regard kakmsik to be derived from kaka--asih (beloved
brother), while K seems not to see it that way, as can be seen in his translation
of geliṭfue (beloved).
Vī9.36c alah umaṅin-aṅén saṅ Jānaki citta luṅhā (he only thought of Jānakī).
K renders it with (doch) door steds aan Sum tle denken vlood ijn geest (but by con-
stantly thinking of Jānakī, he was out of his mind). 1I regard citta luṅū as a
repetition of umaṅén-aṅkn, especially if the construction of the sentence is put this
way: citla luṅhū alah umaṅĕn-aṅĕn saṅ Jānakt.
740

V1.52. My translation varies widely with that of K, and is very hard to
explain.

V1.56d mataṅ ika awamānāYanta mca nwa duṛla. K renders it with duarom
minacht ik de ṭeer laaghartige slechte daad (therefore I scorn the extremely mean and
vile deed). My translation is as follows: that he dared to insult [me] in a de-
based and wicked way ?

VI.58c aku ta maliha Kālomaṭanaṅ Kālamrśyu. The literary translation
should be J will change myself into Kala, the god ṇf Timu, to kill Kala, the Killer. 1In
fact this translation is much stronger than the one in my translation, but
Kalamrĕhu is, so far, known as Kāla, the god of Death. So, to avoid misunder-
standing I use the more popular rendering. K seems to be at a loss to see Kāla
killing Kāla and his rendering reads: Ik ṛal den tjd doen veruallen door den
Doodengod te dooden (I will destroy Time by killing the god of Death).

V1.59d asiṅ-asiṅa ta sādhyān daḍṭw. K regards the word ta as a negatory
particle and his translation reads Ales, alles wat ik bewogde ṛal geschieden (every-
thing, everything I have in mind will come true). My rendering is as follows:
Let ewerything unexpected come, with the understanding that anything unexpected is
usually unpleasant.

VI.62. It is very hard to explain the differences in the translations of this
stanza.

VI.84d apan putrāku drinta wêh. K renders it with want gij ṛjt eenmual
een ṣoon van mjj. (because you are indeed my son). TIt is amazing how K can
forget that the son of the goddess Śrī is the son of Wiṣṇu, perhaps only because
he misreads the word putrāku, and translates it as een ṛoon yan mij (a son of mine),
while it should be read putra-aku ênta (I am a son of yours or because I am your
son).

V1.90d sahāyāntāt palṅ musuh. K renders it with kellp hem dan om êijn
wijand te dooden (so help him to kill his enemy). Literally I would translate this
line into to be your ally when you kill the enemy. The keyword is at (when you). My
view fnds support in stanza 91, cd. which reads: milrāntu ṅ kapi Sugrwwa, niyatālaṅ
ni Rāwaṇa (Makae friends with the monkey Sugrīiwa. Then surely Rāwaṇa will
be defeated).

V1.99b pragrêéhyapāda. K renders it with dwordut ṛṭj de woeten [van Rāma
en Lakṣmaṇa] aanuatte (because she embraced the feet [of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa)).
741

I think the compound consists of two words pragrêkyu (to hold in font of her, to
carryy MW p. 656), and pādu is an abbreviation of pādargṅyācāmanṭa. Hence
my translation. Leonardi is also puzzled by the word pragrñu (see BK, p. 48)
and his translation is more confusing. The Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmrki (HPS. II.155)
reads as follows: ¢‘Approaching that charming hermitage, shaded on all sides
by innumerable trees, they beheld that perfected One who, seeing them, rose up
and with joined palms touched the feet of Rāma and the prudent Lakṣmaṇa
and, according to tradition, offered water to rinse their mouths and bathe their
feet. So, it seems that the Skt original should contain the words pragéṅyapāda
and pādyārghyācamanṣau.

VI.104d madhuparkka. K renders it with honig gerecht (a dish of honey).
I do not know what he means by that, but MW p. 780 says that a kind of mix-
ture of curds with honey etc. is only presented at wedding ceremonies. Leonardiṛs
translation a.o. reads a kong mixture etc. A. Avalon in his book, Principles of
Tantra, p. 1165 up a.o- ‘things needed in ceremonial worship is madhuparka>
which he explains as *honey, ghee, milk and curd>, which is in accordance with
MW. Since the female hermit does not meet Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in a cere-
mony, I base my translation in MW p. 780 into ‘-a mixture of milk and honey>,
which is usually presented to guestss A. Avalon is guoted by H. Zimmer in
Philosopkies of India, p- 583.

VI.105bcd ṅhulun ta magawé tapa, asiṅ sakawĕnaṅ déṅku, kasaṭyanku hĕlĕm-
héĕm. (I perform penance whatever I am able to do, and 1I do it with devotion
regardless of time) This kind of penance or worship is still very popular
amongst the Javanese people, even in Moslem circles, and is perhaps called the
salat dhaim. The main feature of the worship is constantly keeping in mind the
Supreme Being. By doing this, people will be restrained from doing bad
things and will always do everything that is good and proper. K s rendering
reads: ik oefen boete. Al wat in mijn vermogen is, wordt eenmaal later veruuld (I do
penance- All that I can do will sometime in the future be granted).

VI.106c ulpalii bhatāra Wiṣṇu, luṅkā muru ri pālāula. K seems to render
the word ulpatti with birtk as his translation reads 7oen de god Viṣṇu geboren was,
ging hij weg naar de onderwereld (when god Wiṣṇu was born, he went away to the
pether world). It is known that at the liṅgodbawa - episode, god Wiṣṇu was
already grown up, he even claimed to be older than god Brahma. On the other
hand ulpatli is derived from ud +4ṭ/ pat which means to start from, to rise, to jump
out etc. (See MW p. 180). Hence my rendering into it started with god Wiṣṇu
descending to the nether world. See about liṅgodbkawu in e.g. H. Zimmer, Mptks and
Śymbols in Indian Art and Civilization, pp. 128-30.
742

VI.108d amaṅan haraka mami [he] eats my food. K renders it with
[en] at mjin parelsmoer. Apparently K's rendering is based on MW p. 1289, but
I doubt very much whether it is correct. I suspect K of being inuenced by the
Bible in which Christ is said to say......... neither throw your pearls before the
hog.........  (Matthew 7.6.) Nevertheless I cannot find a solution in the
dictionaries. In the story of the sage Domya with his three pupils, Utamanyu,
āruṇika and Wéda in the ādiparwa, it is related that to examine Utamanyu's
devotion and obedience towards his teacher, he is ordered to herd the cattle,
but no food is given to him. The ādiparwa reads as follows: Huraka saṅ
Utamaṇyu mahwan ulik niranasi; nda tan pawwaut nasi taṣwan sira ni daṅ hyaṅ Guru (As
food while herding the cattle Utamanyu eat the rice he obtained from begging,
but he did not give it to his teacher). Because of this deed, Utamanyu is advised
by his teacher that he should not do so, because it means that he is stealing the
property of his teacher. Utamanyu then goes begging for the second time.
His teacher tells him that he may not do so, because he can be regarded as
greedy. So Utamanyu drinks milk, leftovers of the calves. Then the
ādiparwa goes further:  Tinakwanan ta sira haraka nira dé niṅ guru, majar sira
yar pam¥bh tatséṣa niṅ limbwanusu. (He was asked about his food by his teacher;
he said that he milked the cow after her calves had been fed). In the Agastya-
parwa, ed. J. Gonda on p. 374. we read: apilik ta ya riṅ hara, ikaṅ yukti paṅan¥n
in loka ya pinaṅan yu (he is selective in regard to food, he eats only that which is
considered good food by the people). Thus we can conclude that karaku in these
particular places must mean food. However what is Sabara-food or sabarākāra ?
According to MW p. 1052, sabarāhgra is a kind of jujube. Concise Oxford
Dictionary explains that jujube is a kind of edible berry like drupe of certain
plants.

If all the material collected so far contains truth, then we might conclude
that Wiṣṇu in his form as a boar has eaten food of the Sabari, and is subse-
uently killed by it. It might as well be surmised that the food is deliberately
laid as bait for game, because the Sabaris or Sawaras are a wild tribe of hunters.
So it also might happen that the drupe is treated with poison. As far as the
black skin of the Sawaras is concerned, they are indeed black. (See 7ṅr Ocwan
ṭf stoṇ e.g. vol. VIl, so that we may assume that the story in the RK is perhaps
the story of the origin of how the Sawaras obtained their black skin, namely by
eating wild beasts, which died by poisoning. In other words, the poison has
turned their skin black- This is also the case why Śiwa is called Saṅ hyaṅ
743

Nīlakaṇṭha. Other literature concerning the Sawaras, see a.o.:
C.H.: ¢Oldjavanese Kakawin and the Sabaras’, Bkī. 113(1957).
J. Gonda: ‘Tumura’s on Cavara’s', BKr 90(1933).
Tawney: 7âe Ocean 9f stwṇ, vols I, II, I1ī, V, VI, VI-, IX.

VI.119d karṇṇaśmla K renders it with ooruerscheurend (piercing the
ears)- The literary meaning is paiṇful to the earss To find the rhyme I translate
it into thunder, as thunder can be painful to the ears or ear-piercing.

VI.121d mamarimisi. K notes that the meaning of the word mamarimisi
is unknown to him, and offers a surmise that it might originate from the word
pimis, a variant of pipis- J seems to assume that the baseword is murimis (see J's
wl. p- 430) or rimis (p- 471). In my book Līlaracana Rāmāyaṇa (p- 136, 137) I
render the baseword as misi, in fact I would like to add a variant of it namely
misin, because in V-44b, mss. ACE reads yamarimisin, whilst mss BD agree with
Kīs reading yamarimisi. I base my reading on mss ACE, because I think it may
give a solution to the riddle of its origin. In my opinion misi or misin should
originate from isi or isin. So misi or misin are abbreviations of umisi or umisin.
The form marimisi can be analysed into pari + (m)isi, whilst yamarimisi originates
from ya-a-pari-(m)isi In N.J- we have the word isin which derivatives, ngisin-isin
means exactly the same as marimisi (to ridicule, to tease)- On the other hand in
NJ. we have also the word ĕsi and angèsi-ĕsi meaning the same as marimisi (See
also G ñ R. I90)- To conclude, I think it can be stated that the word mamurimisi
is derived from the base word isi or isin, which in NJ- develop into êsi and
isin.

VI.122. See also my translation of this stanza in my article Tke word tgji
in the RX.

V1.134c n-ton téka saṅ Roghusutmsusupan bkramanta. 1It seems that K renders
bkramanta with ongerust (uneasy) while in fact it means wandering. Hence my
translation into coming and asusupan I render with tkrough thickets. Also Ks
rendering of line b. is not very fortunate.

Vl139d tan wismayan paṅ¥busan mamisan wi;a ṇya. K renders the line
with ket is niet te verwonderen dat hun gif doodeljjk is waar het ingesnowen wordt (it is
not surprising that their venom can cause death, even if it is breathed in) and
then adds a remark: Er ṛal bedoeld ijn, dut het slangengif aldaar de lucht er van
doodelijk is (The meaning should be, that the venom of the snake is so deadly,
even if one breathes it in). |
744

In N.J. the expression disêémbur ula means to be bitten by a snake and
affected by its venom, not that the snake spouts its venom out and by accident
someone sniffs in the venom.

V1.159d 7arā sirābyudaya bhoga pṅala ṇya bhuktin. (Tārā was the for-
tune that came as the result of the offering which [Sugrīwa] would relish). K s
rendering, Tārā genietende van de gelukkige uitkomst was de uruchl die genoten ṛou
worden (Tārī enjoying the fortunate result was the fruit that would be enjoyed),
is rather misleading, as e.g. in the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki (HPS I1.202) īārā
advised Bālī to delay the fght, and when Bāli was slain, Tārā's grief was
genuine (HPS. I1.215-218).

VI.163d siraṅ monāmomo mari muna manonton pada humuṅ XK renders it
with īij ṛwegen beteuterd still. 7oen ṛij ophielden te ṛwiījgen, keken 2ij toe met luid
gerogp (they were silent and dumbfuunded- When they ceased to be silent, they
looked on, noisily shouting). The impression I obtain from this passage is, that
there are silent monks amongst the sages watching the fight between Bāīlī and
Sugrīwa. The silent monks are then carried away by the sight so that they
forget their vow and noisily join the crowd cheering and booing. Hence my
translation which reads *Those monks who had pledged to silence were carried
away and forgetting their pledge they joined in noisily->

VI.196. See also my translation of this stanza in my article, entitled 7ṅe
word tgji in the Rāmāyaṇa Kukawin, in which I attempt to refute Hooykaas¹ accusa-
tion that the Oldjavanese poet substitute the word arrow with cockspur. 1I show
clearly that the word tgji in the RK means in fact arrow, not cockspur as Hooy-
kaas (see 3K/, 113) and other Dutch scholars used to believe- In this article it
is also explained that the golden fower is not duly laid on the deceased monkey-
king (Bālī), like Hooykaas and the others would have us believe, but that Bmlī,
the dying monkey-king took the golden flower from his neck and handed it over
to his brother Sugrīwa. The Oldjavanese poet is not to blame that so much
confusion has been created, as the text is clear and faultless Even
Jasadipoera, who wrote the N.J. Serat Rama is correct in his rendering at this
particular place.

VI.199a ménak tambkk nira lawan ikaṅ wānurālanta tuṣlu. K is doubtful
to whom nira refers. I am certain it refers to Rāma, because ifit refers to the
apes, the author would possibly use the word nika or nikā See my argument
about it in my article: The Samāya of Bharaḍah and Kuturan’. in Induwnesia, no.

17 (April, 1974, p. 54, note no. 11).
745

VIn.5a rgjah tamah. ]J. renders rajah tamak with the more common
lexical meaning (newel en duisternis) which I regard inappropriate to the context,
as it is indeed rather extraordinary to compare a rainbow with mist and darkness.
I discover in MD p. 252, rgjah explained as colow, passion, redness and tamas on
p. 107 as darkness, gloom of hell, igrorance, delusion. Hence my translation into
colour 9f delusion

VIr6b harṣa yadulu-dulur paḍāputih (ying in lines, white in colour). Js
rendering which compares mating kerons with Manmata's bannier is again hard to
believe, besides how could those herons mate while they are flying.

VI1.9a *kaṇika gadgadu ] regard this phrase to be the eguivalent of
gulu nirāṣké. Hence my translation into kis throat finched-

VIī.38d ujari yan mapāmbkk nikū. (tell him that he is sinfull.  J renders
it with uraag hem, hoe zijre gezindheid is (ask him what he is inclined to do). My
rendering sounds much stronger, as I get the impression that Rāma is very
angry- Another thing that constitute the difference is thatJ renders mapa with
what, whilst I translate it into to sin. The word yjur is in fact a very strong ex
pression of anger in NJ- e-g: yjar-ujarana=abuse [him]!

Vṛī4lb ṅhulun [n]iki katuhwan karah: (ī am very bad). J apparently
has an opposite opinion to mine, as he renders the phrase with want ik ben ouer-
tuigd (because I am convinced). Or he might mean *because I have seen [my
mistake]> If this is correct, then the difference with my translation is not as
grave as I saw beforee The phrase katuhwan might mean in NJ kebangelen or in
B.ī. keterlaluan (too bad)

VṛI.62a hana ta manuk madulu-dulur (birds, one after the other...). J renders
it with die hen vergezelden (which accompanied them), which implies that the birds
came to the monkeys, which is not true, because before the birds came out of
ṭhe cave, the monkeys had not seen the cave, and there is no implication
at all that the birds came to the place where the monkeys had taken a rest.

VI9.74d praśāstébuṅku Mirusāwarṇṇi (my famous mother was Mérusā-
warṇṇi) J remarks that K has already translated this stanza in his article
Eon merkwaardige teksverkwoeiing in °t Ouḍjavaansche Rānāyanu, in BKl. 49(1897-1898)
171-173. K, among others, states that the text iṣ corrupt, because the metre is
ṇot correct, but the main problem he puts forward is in fact, that according to
a Bombay edition of the Rāmāyaṇa, Mérusawarṇi is a man, and could not
746

possibly be the mother of Swayamprabha (p. 172-3). He further mentions that
in a Bengalese edition of the Rāmāyaṇa he knds instead of Mérusāwarṇṇi, the
name Hémasāwarṇṇi. At the time K translated the stanza, and again guoted
by J., the translation of HPS had not been published- HPS, II, p. 297, has the
answer to part of these problems. I guote Swayamprabhā, saying: I, Swayam-
prabhā by name, the daughter of Mérusāwarṇṇi, guard this dwelling bclonging
to Héma, who skilled in the arts of dancing and singing, is my dear frend, O,
Foremost of Monkeyslè So Héma is the friend of Swayamprabhā, but still we
do not know whether Mérusāwarṇṇi is a male or female person according to the
Skt. original story of the Rāmāyaṇa. The dānawarūja in HPS is called Mava, the
chief architect of the dānawus and a student of Wiśwakarmmā, who is the god
of arts and crafts (see H. Zimmer, p- 3) .In another source, Mjth of the Hindus and
Buddhists, p. 12, Wiśwakarmman is a demon-king (4ānawarāja). 1In the Oldja-
vanese RK., Maya is not mentioned, so that we receive the impression that
Wiśwakarmmā madc the cave, and he too was the one slain by Indra, and that
Swayamprabhā was his daughter by Mérusawarṇṇi. It seems to me that the
drama happens this way. Maya, the student of Wiśwakarmmā, husband of
Meérusāwarṇṇi, and the father of Swayamprabhā wants to marry Héma, after he
has constructed the building in the cave- Indra, the king of the gods, apparently
in love with Héma himself, kills Maya and gives the building in the cave to
Héma. Héma, being a friend of Swayamprabhā, engages Swayamprabhgī as
warder of the building, so that she does not need to look for accommodation
somewhere else- In the Javanese shadowplay, Swayamprabhāī is the wif of
Hanūmān at the time of the Pāṇḍawas.

VI1I.89a. kami (we) All the mss. reads kitu As kitu in Oldjavanese
usually means you (second person, singular or plural), e.g. in stanza 88, kitīri
Jaṭĕwu, I replace kita with kawi, to avoid confusion. On the other hand I do
not amend śarṭranta (st. 91) into śarwraṅku, because the speech can be regarded
as coming from the monkeys themselves, urging each other to give their lives to
the bird Sampāti.

VII.ll12e. hkana ta iwak wrs pada ya lumumpat. J translates it into er
waren ook visschen, die sprongen als upen (there were also fish, which jumped like
monkeys). Apparently J does not know that ṅwak wré is the Skt. jalakapi which
is a dolphin (see MD. p. 99)- Makara should not be translated into dolphins
here, but prawns. See my explanation about it in my article *Makara>, in
Relung Pustaka, Augustus, 1970, p. 24-7.
747

VIiI.13d yan sampun marĕn apanas lumakwa sigra (when it is no longer hot,
you can goon)  J renders it als gij niet langer verhit ijt, āult gij snel verder gaan
(when you no longer feel hot, you can go faster). In this stanza only the heat
of the sun is mentioned, not Hanūmān’s. In NJ. this phrase is very freuently
used, e.g- Jèn wis mari panus, maṅkat manék (when [the sun] is not hot anywore,
[we] can go further.)

Vīir.24b kali luṅka yakuliliṅan kumaluṅi J seems to put a fullstop aker
kumaluṅ, so that his translation reads die ṛich rondom kronkelden (which wound
around). Around what is not mentioned. My reading is that the river winds
ṇround a mountain, which [together with the mountain] constitutes a tremen-
dous defence line.

Vīiī.3la jasra w¥gig (formulas to ensure victory). G X R II71l ex-
plains that wegig means skilled, expert in. So I understand śastra w¥gig, as a for-
mula that creates skill, power etc. in men, to ensure success. J renders wĕgig
with onbeschaamd (impudent, impertinent) which is not listed in G  R, nor in
Pigeaud's Javaans - Nederlands Handwoordenboek. The translation of lines
b.c.d., is therefore so diferent from mine, that it is difcult to compare-

VīIL32a waték map¥kén (went to the foodstalls). A gulmu is a military
unit, and in line c. there is mention of their habit in eating. The literal trans-
lation of watśk mapĕkên is [to form] a group to ṭh markel, hence my translation into
went to the fwdstalls: J on the other hand renders it with dat een markt hield
(who held a market) I find it rather strange that a unit of soldiers is holding a
market

V]Iī.33cd manĕwĕr pupu...... am¥cĕl-mécél...... There are various ways
of cooking meat in Indonesia, one of which is called masak pścé, which in Old-
javanese is termed ṇmwḍl-mśāl This kind of dish is always spicy and very hot,
because many chillies are used- So I understand that the pupu is being cooked
into p¥cél, whilst J seems to combine pścḍ with the kulub-kulubar.

VIIī.45c w¥tu niṅ wulan dadi humis ya malts. The rendering of J which
is followed by P closely forms a literal ṭranslation, without considering logic.
Indeed humts can be translated literally into uloeien or uloeibaar, but that the
pearls or sands ṭurned into water seems to me a bit far-fetched. 1In N.J. there is
the word umês which means wet, hence my translation into there wus a deuull
and [tke air] turmed cold. We should remember that this phrase is not a comparison
but a statement, a description of the temple at that particular time. From VIL.
41.-59, P has translated the RK in 7.36., vol 72.
748

VIīI47a tambak (stone walk). J renders it with dammen, P. with ringmuren.
Further P. renders line d- with waren te vergelijken met het luidruchtig geluid van de
(gekarnde Melk-) ṛee. My translation and J's do not make any reference to the
Milk-ocean. See also note on stanza 57a.

VII149a ikana prasādu i yawa nya kahbéh (all the temples outsidc). P’s
rendering is close to mine, while J translates it into de tempel was van buiten geheel
gevuld met gouden beelden, (the temple was from outside completely ñlled with
golden statues), which I find too fanciful, as the temple in guestion is not the
main temple, which is compared with the Mandara mountain, but the warana
temple- I have the impression that with de tempel J in fact means the main

temple.

VII1.51la swwuk lawaṅ. P’s explanation concerning the suwuk lawaṅ
as the kāla-head ornament above the door of a temple is very admissible. See
further about this, which I can understand as kwtimukha (the face of glory) in
the book of H.- Zimmer, Myths and Śymbols in Indian Art and Ciuilization, p. 180-4.
Yet I could not accept it in this particular place. The translation of P. contains
too many words which are not found in the text but are needed to connect the
suwuk lawaṅ with ikaṅ pratima- Further the comparison of the suwuk lawaṅ with
Rāhu after the Samudramanthana seems not to be in the right place here. Rāhu
here should be understood as still having a complete body. So ikaṅ pratima
suwuk lawaṅ which look like Rāhu, are nothing else than the images of demons
as gatewardens. Though in the Samudramanthana, Rāhu is not mentioned as
taking part in the churning of the ocean, a statement to the contrary is also not
known. See further VIlI.52.

VIīI.52. In this stanza the gatewardens (suwuk lawaṅ) are compared with
the poison kālakūṭa, which usually has the appearance of a demon, running
away from the battlefeld, out of fear of god Śaṅkara. As known, the kālakā/a-
poison is another version of the story of the origin of amrêta, also found in Old-
javanese literature, e.g. the Tantu Paṅgĕlaran. As kalakāṭa is said to be running
away, it should be assumed that he has still his complete body, not mutilated in
any way.

We see here that Ps translation is at fault, as he probably overlooks the
story of the kwtimukka- 1t is impossible for the suwuk lawaṅ (kuttimukhu) to run
away from god Śaṅkara, because it is the manifestation of śaṅkara>s own power.
(See H. Zimmer, Myts and......, p. 180).
749

VIII.54-55. There are various differences in the translations of P and J
and mine, which are difñcult to dekne and to trace what the reasons are.
This is perhaps one of the examples where the translations are to be regarded
as alternatives.

VIīI.57a tambak (canal). P renders tambak with een hooge ommuuring (a
high ring-wall), J is in doubt whether to render it with dam (canal) or djk (dike).
I render it with canal, more or less inAuenced by line c, whilst P and J seem to
be at a loss there. (See also note on stanza 47a).

VIII.6la. I cannot trace what the euivalent in the text would be of the
word kjj (he) in the rendering ofJ. Without doubt it refers to Hanūmān. In
my view stanzas no. 61 and 62 describe the demon-guards who passed their time
by doing exercises, to improve their skill in combat.

VIII.64-67. The images created by my translation and that of J are guite
different.

VIII.90cd *kên-kéṇyāṅkśn tan pakênmrryakĕn, dodot ṭyālit sutra l;n luṅsir abkrm.
J does not understand what tan pakśnārṇyakśn means, hence his confused trans-
lation. tan pakśn;ryakśn is derived from tan pak¥na--arryakĕn both elements
meaning not to wear or to leave out- dodut: staatsiekleed om het onderlif gedragen
(G & R, I, 582) luṅsir == band (Pi. Javaans-Ned. wb, p- 246). Hence my trans-
lation.

VI11.92a yaikā  J renders it with j (she) referring to Sitā. It is very
unlikely that the author would refer to Sītā in that way. See my argument in
my article ‘The samaya of Bharaḍah and Kuturan'

VīII.106- This stanza describing Sītā's condition is very popular amongst
the Javanese through Jasadipoera’s version. Though Jasadipoera’s rendering,
regarded from the philological point of view has many faults, I dare to say
in poetical value it is more beautiful and produces a stronger appeal and
emotion.

VIīI.108d maṅyjiwat alah pyji The literary rendering should be ogling
and praising. J does not translate the words alak pyji as he thinks they are irre-
levant.

VIII.120a tañā jalani J remarks that the meaning of taājalani (note his
spelling) is not clear to him. If he separates taā from jalani perhaps the meaning
750

will dawn on him, taā (not) jalani from jalan (to do, to perform). Hence my
rendering into you do not need to keep lo the good path, meaning that Sītā does not
need to be faithful to Rāma, because nobody would dare to criticize her, because
of fear of Rāwaṇa.

VIIī135. This stanza is based on mss. A and C. Apparently K. also
intended to include it in his edition, as ms. A. is also used by him and that he
skipps from stanza no. 134 to stanza no- 136.

VII1.137c sabarin ya tan pamatiké etc. It seems that the word yu is re-
garded as 3rd pers., sing- by J.. whilst I regard it just as a part of sabarin ya
This phrase is still very freuently used in the wgyaṅ-play.

VIII.l48ab tan hanā juga. J seems to regard the phrase as part of the
following line, which is evident in his notes. tan hanā juga (with an a irrealis
in hana) means to pass away, to diee Hence my translation. In the NJ.
sentences like bapaké wis rong taun ora ana or in B.l. ṇyahnya sudak2 tahun tidak ada

still exist.

VIII-152a bāp aku. J reads bāpaku and render it with vader (father)
which is totally incorrect.

VIīI.l56. Jjs translation is confusing because of faulty reading

VII1.l66b balisah masgra buli māṇwa tan māat. J reads smaārabali as one
word or compound, and becomes lost. Balisahṅ masāru, lit. translated reads anxiely
is increasing in strength; bali mālya tan mā;ti, lit. translated will read on the other hand
[Z] want to die, but [I] cannot.

VIIL.l77c naréndra. J apparently refers to king Janaka, the father of
Śītā, whilst I am inclined to refer to Rāma, based on the story further on
(XVI1.92-99, XXVI.40-45) that they always pray for the safety and victory of
Rāma. Also the following stanza 178, in which is related that Hanūmān was
very happy to see that performance, seems to point to Rāma.

VIII.l91c b,hiṣama yan kasiddha ja. In my view it is better to read
tan kasiddha rather than yan kasiddha. Hence my translation. It seems that ya
and ta are confused in the mss. See e.g- stanza 137c. If the text reads sabarin ṭu
tan pamatiké, it will be less ambiguous.

VIī1.206c tgya śoka ṅwaṅ maṅaraṅ. J's rendering is illogical. How could
Rāma be willing to ignore 5ītā's suffering 7 My translation however suggests
751

that Sītā wants Rāma not to worry about hcr, because Sītā is no longer worried
herself, because she knows about his plans.

IX.3d *kusumawicitra (various owers) (See M.W., p. 298). J renders it
with verspreide bloemen (scattered flowers).

IX.14c wugari hilaṅ yéka makahalintaṅ J remarks that the word
makahalintaṅ is not clear to him- Apparently he has misread it, e.g. reading it
as follows maka-halintaṅ whilst the correct reading should be ma-kakalintaṅ.

IX.15d wulu nira tuṅgal tuwi taya siṅsal. Again J's reading is at fault.
He separates ta from ya- From his notes, it is apparent that he has pondered
over this line very deeply.

IX.19a kabubut bĕnlis. This is a type of kicking in the silat martial art.
The leg is swung for a kick, while the body turns to the back. Sometimes the
first move forward is done with one leg, but the ñnishing kick is performed with
the other leg. This is why it is said to be kabubat which literary means kit by a
swinging thing. 1If we do not read kabubaut together with bkntis, then the thing
which was swung about should be the candana-tree. Then we have, more or less,
a translation like Js.

IX.27- Seec also my translation in my article *The samaya of Bharaḍah
and Kuturan.

IX.30c kumĕêbu-kĕbu libg; (to fall in heaps). J bases his translation on
the Balinese translation mapupahan, but he considers that the word should be
read mapupuhan. 1 think mapupahan perhaps mean, to fall upon each other,
like in N.J- timpah-timpahan which means in B-I. bertimpa-timpaan or bertindih-
tindihan.

IX.68-69. ]J is confused by the text, which says that the demons are con-
founded, as at times they see Hanūmān alone, and at other times there are many
Hanūmāns, and also the size of Hanūmān is sometimes small, sometimes big
(anékarāpa). That Hanūmāmān can expand his size or become small, we know
from other episodes, for e.g. when he is flying to Lĕṅkā, he expands his body
(VI1I.3a), and when he is swallowed by Wikaṭākṣiṇī he also expands his body
(VII1.20). However when he was already approaching the city of Lĕṅkā passing
through the mountain of Suwéla, he shrank himself into the size of a hare in
broad daylight (VIIī.23). With regard to the number, it might be because he
752

moved so fast, that he looked as if he were everywhere, or it may have been a
spell which he put on the demons. This kind of ability or power is freuently
found in Skt- or Javanese literatures, and is called kāya-wyāha (division of per-
sonality). See Tawney, Tâe Ocean ṭf Stoṇ, IV 4.

IX.80b tan aṅgêh ta yāmbśk niran tan pacihna. ]J's rendering niet ongerust
te gijn en niets te laten blṭjken (not to worry and not to show the least uneasiness),
cannot be said as an alternative to my translation *who does not want to be
without evidence- The author for sure talks about *this evidence> again, when
Hanūmān returns to his friend at mount Mahéndra (X.10-12), and especially
refers to the arrow which remains sticking on Hanūmān's thigh, the author says:
mwaṅ taṅgwan yékanola kanin ira ya guha datutulyékanaṅ rāh (and the arrow [sticking
on his thigh] is a snake, his wounds the caves and the blood the datu [fowing
forth])) No trace of this kind is found in J's rendering-

IX.8lc aākāra pārṇṇa. In his note J suggests reading the above phrase
as akarṇṇapurṇṇa, despite the fact that it is found in the Wirāṭaparwwa. I can-
not agree with J's view, Krstly because the phrase makes good sense in the
context, that is, peṛfect shape (MW, p- 127), while akarṇṇa according to MW p. l
means without ears, degf, without helm etc. which is not in accordance with Js
rendering:

IX.82 J's description of the snake-arrow is totally incorrect. Perhaps
he is puzzled by the word māwān which he renders with 2wo kogg (as high as). I
render it with enormous.

IX.86b ]J's rendering suggests that Méghanāda talks to Hanūmā;n, as he
uses the word gī (thee), though stanza 87 says that those words are the words of
Méghanāda to his soldiers. Also the word puṇḍut in stanza 86c seems for J to
have no connection at all with inusuṅ-usuṅ in stanza 87b. Besides if we study the
relieé of the Penataran Rāmāyaṇa reliefö, we should then see that my rendering
is closer to the text.

IX.88d ndya ṅ dharmma ndya ṅ kawikwar. The translator should
remember that the demons are talking about the messenger of Rāghawa who,
they think, should behave like Rāghawa who is known to live in the woods as

an ascetic.

X.8a satĕka ṅka ri tamanku. Intentionally or not, J. seems to read ṅku
instead of ṅka of the text and translates it into ik (I), which in my opinion creates
753

a wrong picture, because in the story, whether Rāwaṇa is in the garden or
not, the Sun is always cool and the wind does not dare to blow hard, as e.g
related in IX.5, 6.

X.11d tan pṭhahatahwanara dnta (You should not kill a monkey). It
seems, that a monkey belongs to a very low class of animals. Hence the
disdainful attitude of Rāwaṇa towards Hanūmān. Hanūmān however
cleverly used this classication as a weapon to show how wrong Rāwaṇa
would be if he killed him. Besides, he was a messenger, alone, and without
defence- Apparently the status of an ape was also used by Bālī when he accused
Rāma of performing a wrong and sinful deed by killing him- Rāma replied
however that he as a kṣatrYa can kill any animal, but if Bālī claimed not to be
an animal, but a man, Rāma still did not sin, because Bālī had committed
adultery, which was a good reason for killing him- 1In the case of Hanūmān,
Rāwaṇa is a rākṣasa, and a rākṣasa is much higher in classiñcation than a monkey,
even higher than human beings. This is the main reason why Rāwaṇa did not
ask of Brahmā to become invulnerable against human beings, because he was
already invulnerable against deities, who were classifed much higher than
yākṣasas- See concerning this classifcation of creatures in the Agastyaparwa, ed.
J- Gonda.

X.32b pgjarmwiṇṇaku ṅuri. ]J. renders it with egt gī, heb ik mij vroeger
yerworven (you say, I have obtained them in the past). In my view this is rather
distorted. irṇaku means to me. Thus the literally translation should be: you said
to me formerly.

X.43cd makira-kira maraṅ duta, moṅĕn-aṅtn mopaya. J's rendering ke
past een geṛant, om plannen to beramen en er op te ṇinnen, hoe men zal bedriegen, is hard
to understand, so that I do not dare to transiate it, especially the last part. Is it
appropriate for an envoy [of a nation] to deceive other people?

X.45d apu ta halśpakśn molak (what is the use of being angry). Literally
ṭhe translation should read: what is the use of being too actiwe. The NJ expression
for moluh here is perhaps kakékan polah (too active, to waste energy). J suspects
the text to be corrupt, as he cannot understand the words hal¥pakĕn molaṅ.
When I read the mss. they appear to be alright, and all mss. contain the same
text.

X.60b fyak (stomach). J renders it with djj (thigh). If we study the
relief of this episode at the temple of Prambanan, we can see that the arrow
754

of Rāma pierces Mārica’s stomach. (See Stutterheim, Rāma Legenden elc., II,
plate no. 33).

X.64a tĕka mam¥¥g ikaṅ duṛṣṭa. I regard ikaṅ duṣṭa as the subject, whilst
J. regards it as the object and creates a subject from elsewhere. He repeats it
in stanza 65.

X.70d /risakiti ta hali ṇwa wêh saranta. J. reads prisakiti ta\ Hasi nya
wĕh saranta- Huti ṇyu is here the object which is still very common in B.I. Thus
one can say, sakiti dia, or the older form of structure will be sakit matawa, sakiti
hatinya- Saranta means slow, long time.

X.7lc jamaṅ (diadem). J. is puzzled by this word, as it seems unlikely
to him, that Hanūmān would have given such an expensive crown to wear. In-
stead I wonder whether it was customary in ancient days to put a crown, or
to be more exact a mock-crown, on the head of a person who was sentenced
to death, e.g. Jesus Christ on his way to cruxifction. The cruxifiction
itself proved not to be a new invention, but had already become a custom at

that time-

XI'lb duruṅ taṅ uñah ṅka riṅ antahpura (heading for the buildings of the
inner city).  J renders antahpura with vrouwenverṭrek (women's room, apartment,
guarters)- I think female uarters is too small a part of the city, hence my
translation into inner city which I imagine to consist of the entire compound of
the royal palace including the government buildings and the mansions of nobili-
ties and high ranking ofñcials.

XI.2a 7ripuru pura murub etc. J's translation is surprising, he seems to
forget that īśwara had burnt the city or palace of īripura. It is a very well-
known story. Sce e.g- H. Zimmer, Mptks and Śymbuls etc., p- 185-9.

XI.9d tapwan mujar sira ndān guyu nira mamanis nā paṅawruh nikaṅ wri. J
renders it with kji sprak nog niet, doch hij lachte liṭfelijk, daaraan ṛag men, dat hj een
aap was (he had not yet said a word, but he smiled nicely, that was why
one could see that he was an ape). In my view the last part ofJ's translation
is at fault. wré here refers to the monkeys who were coming to Hanūmān.

X:14a krama kāalu (time passed). I cannot understand why J. translates
the phrase above into ’s Awonds (in the evening, at night) It is improbable thṅt
Hanūmān chose to travel at night, because before he went to Lĕṅkā, Sugrīwa
755

advised him to be careful, when they camped at night (aṅkinś), because there
were many rangers of the night (demons). See VI1.50.

X9.22c mwaṅ cāḍāmaṇi tulya ni ṅhulun etc. J seems to change the order
of the words and creates a confused picture in his translation. Line d, is con-
fusing too, because he divides it into two sentences

XJ.24cd- The guestion mark seems to mark J's translation, as my
impression is that the translation of the Oldjavanese text should be the other
way around.

XI.27a hawya kataṅguhan The literal translation should be do nut let
yourself be remembered. Hence my translation into please remember- J seems to
translate hgywa (do not) into niet (not).

Xī.31ab. J's understanding of the word hulun (slawin) is the keyword to
his misunderstanding of the two lines, as it gives the impression that she is a
slawe-girl in Lêṅkmā- In fact, she realizes now that ṣhe, as the wife of her lord and
master Rāma, should behave and act as his slave-girl.

X1.39d sira tapw sakunaṅ-kunaṅ ya tāléṅ. I cannot comprehend J's
translation īṭj is als het vuur met blinkende yuuruliegen (she is like the ñre with
gleaming fireflies). In the following stanza he renders wu (the apw in stanza 39)
with gloeiende kool (burning coal)

XI.46d lanā hanéṅ citta ya kéargī nira I cannot see who the ki (he) is
in Js translation woortdurend is hjj in hare gedachtn. The only male in the
stanza are the domkoppen (fools) in line b, which makes the translation more
incredible-

X1.50b madan tikaṅ wré maṅusuṅ-usuṅ masö. J renders this as follows:
De apen maakten zich gereed, allerlei dingen ueruoerende en naar voren tredende (The
monkeys made their preparations, carrying all kinds of things along and stepped
forward). Clearly J has misunderstood the text and thereby depicts an incorrect
picture, because he separates wré fiom muṅusuṅ-usuṅ, whilst in fact wré maṅusuṅ-usuṅ
are lhose monkgws assigned to carw Rama and Lakṣmaṇa. HPS. III.10 reads: And
those foremost ṇf men, borne on the shoulders of the monkṇs, appeared beautiful like lhe sun
and moon, in conjunction with those two greal planets, Rāhu and Ketu, and honoured
hy the King of the Monkg's and Lakṣmaṇa, Rāma accompanied śy his arny, proceeded
towards the south.
756

XI.5lb sara. J remarks that he cannot understand its meaning in the
context. I hold the view that its general meaning sara-=strengtṅ, power(ful) fits
the context. I render it with krmb.

XI.57d dudā ṅ manuk kinnara jww-jwu ya. I changed the order of the
words into dudā ṅ manuk juwa-jwwa kinnara ya. Hence my translation not to mention
the jiwa-jiwa-birds which were the kinnaras- No trace of the kinnarus is found in J's
renderings.

XI.71c pralgya warāhu (the boar of doom). 1It seems, that what is meant
by the boar of doom is the incarnation of Wiṣṇu as a boar saving the goddess
Earth from being sucked into the sea by a powerful serpent-king. (See H.
Zimmer, Mytks and Ṣymbols etc., p- 77-9).

XI.77cd saṅ śrṛ Raghusuta belongs together. J does not see it this way
and that is why in his translation the goddess Śrī becomes sick.

XIl.llabc yan wruh ri lwir nikanaṅ inak riṅ murcca, yan yśkānuṅ parama
sumukr*ṅ yoga yśka lwir niṅ mati ta kunaṅ liṅ niṅ rā. The belief in mithuna (coition)
not only as a symbol of the union of Śiwa and Śakti for procreation, but also
Bliss, is common in Tantric treatises, which also seem to havebeen very popular
in Indonmesia in the past. One feature, which in Skt. is called the Pañcatattwa
or Pañcamakāra, is known to the present day in Java as the ma-lima (the fve
m*), these are madut (taking drugs), madon (coition), main (gambling), minum
(drinking liguor) and malirg (stealing). The slight difference is perhaps brought
out by the Moslims, who made a crusade against these five vile acts. To return
to the mithuna, Mulk Raj Anand mentions that the Kāpālikas located the soul
in the yoni and believed that mokṣa could be attained by the complete enjoyment
of woman. (See F. Leeson, Kamu Shkilu, p. 51-2).

XII.20c cumbananuka.
85ab stri mulat ri ḍaḍa nin wara kami, n-ton wuri ṇya ginarut priya ṅuni,
36b n-ton wuri nya manahut pipi mar mrik.
From the uotations above we can see that the cumbananaku (caresses with
scratches) seem also to include tooth-bites. It seems that here is only the
scratches on the breast and bites on the cheeks, which according to Wāītsyāyana's
Kāma-sūtra consists of eight kinds of nail marks and also eight kinds of tooth-
bites. See The Ocean 9f stoṛṇ, V.193-5 which has an extract of the Kāma-sūtra
of Wātsyāyana, translated by K. Rangaswami Iyengar, Lahore 1921. See also
757

Ṣir Richard Burton's translation of the Anaṅga-raṅga, titled Tâe Hindu Art of
Love, and The Kamu Sutra 9f Vatṣyayana.

XII.38. See my translation of this stanza in my article The word lgji in the

RX.

XīI.45c mārin méraṅ I render n in mārin with ske, as in previous stanzas
jt was the wife that was bashful or shy, not the husband as rendered by J with
hij (he).

XJI.52. Concerning the nature of the demors, see eg- Agaspu parwa, ed.
by J.- Gonda, p- 370.

XII44cd yapuut taṅgé yan wiléta ṅké ri gulmṅku, byaktan tuta saparantāku
katahyan. The literal translation reads 4s long as you tie up my neck, clearly I will
fallow you everywhere, us I am tied up. This literal translation might be the real
meaning of the lines, because tying up the necks of bride and groom with a
sacred cord is customary in marriages according to Hinduism. See P- Thomas,
Hindu Religion, Customs and Manners, Bombay, 1956, p. 92. In other words the
lines above means: As long as we are married, I am bound to you.

XīII.lld nahan duméh nyāku pi saniscgṅ pati (this convinces me of his
death) J renders it dat is the reden, dat ook ik ongetwijfeld al sterven (that is the
reason, that I too will surely die)- At the death of Daśamukha, there is no
mention about the death of his mother or his wives in the RK. Even in the
Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki, only the lamentations of Rāwaṇaés consorts and gueen
Mandodarī are mentioned, but not their death, let alone that of Rāwaṇaīs
mothers. The Bhatṭikāvya spends only one stanza describing *the grief of the
women of the harem>, but does not mention their death also- So J's translation

is ṇot tenable-

XīII.13d priken lśmĕn wara-warahên riṅ āgama (try hard to instruct him by
means of religion). J renders agama with wetenschap (science)- My rendering
is based on what Wibhīṣsaṇa said in the council, trying to convince Rāwaṇa and
his subjects of their wrong conduct, which was not in accordance with the holy
ṣcriptures: Wibhīaṇa guoted the nitiśāstra, and explained the ngya ṣaḍguṇa,
janānuragu etc etc.

XIII.lĕc mad¥g ta sādara umasö sirāśla. J renders it hij stond uriendeljjk

op en schogf hem een zetel toe (he /apparently Rāwaṇa, the king/ stood up in a
friendly manner and gave him a seat) My translation gives the impression that
758

all the actions taken in this stanza are Wibhñaṇa’s, the king (Rāwaṇa) is just
sitting on his throne- It is unbelievable that king Rāwaṇa, haughty and
proud as he was, would stand up to greet his younger brother, as J's translation
suggests.

XII1.19d **kapwa patik, wuwus nira. The punctuation I place on the
phrase above, is the basis of my rendering. which reads, sṇying: *Well my
ministers> J renders it with mes geregelde woorden (with orderly words).

XIīII.30d ruṅur-muṅur durṇṇṇya lumbu tan paki. J renders muṅur-muṅur
with weelderig (luxurious, luxuriant). His v.l. on p. 82 gives glwiend (glowing,
burning) as its meaning. muṅur-muṅur in N.J. means nauseus, which is appropriate
in the context, as rhubarb may cause nausea. Hence my translation.

XIII3la balik dahat J renders it with 2eer uerkeerd (very wrong),
which I find inappropriate in the context. I render it with very difrrent [in com-
parison with his conduct in the past as suggested by the text further].

XIII.33b hulunta tuṅgal wĕnaṅomaṅāna ya. J renders it with dan 2ou één
hogfd van u in staat īijn, haar te verṛwelgen (then one of your heads is able to devour
her) So hkulunta is analysed by ]J. as hulu (head) 4- nta (your), so that he comes
to that incredible rendering- hulunta is derived from hulun (slave) r ta (your)
meaning yowr slawe, and in this case meaning I. hulunta tuṅgal is patik seorang in
BI.( alone)} Js translation of the last two lines is faulty, because of wrong
interpretation of the words śrṭ warargja which should be understood as meaning
Rāwaṇa (my lord in my translation), not woortrṭśhelijke worsten (outstanding kings)
as understood by J.

XII1.34 1lawan [n] ikaṅ wanara muḍa tan pira. J's reading is at fault
here, he stops after wānara, while the correct stop should be after māḍs. So I
read lawan [n] ikaṅ wanara māḍa/tan pira (and [in the case of] the stupid monkeys,
it is nothing)- J's wl- on p- 128, gives as meaning for kśpêl-kśpĕl, samengebalde
rijst, and for kśpś-kśpél: ontbṭjt (breakfast). I take the latter, because for Prahasta,
a breakfust is certainly less than lunch or dinner, at least that seems to have
been in the mind of the Javanese writer of the RK. See also XXII.12a, where
Kumbhakarṇṇa also has his breakfast (kĕpêl-kĕpê).

XII151b awus ya soréka musuk nirṅṅ rana. J renders it with is het duidelij,
dat hij kal onderdoen woor den vijand in den strijd (it is clear, that he will be defeated
by the enemy in battle). I get the impression, that J- had divided the stanza into
two units, the lines a b and c d, and between them there seems no relation at all.
759

XIII.54-66. I must admit, that there are too many things that confuse me
when reading J's translation, so that I cannot explain the discrepancies.

XIII.67c inupāya. J renders it with bedriegen (to deceive), whilst I regard
it as synonymous to pinriṅ, to emphasize the meaning.

XIīI.76ab Sirāta mitrānta taman sasambhawa, apan paḍa krodha paḍāṅhiḍśp
lara. J translates these lines into uwe vrienden echter ṛijn niet passend, want īīj ijn
allen toornig en slecht geṛind (your friends however are not fktting, because they
are all malicious and ill-natured). In my view the connection between a b and
c d is hard to ñnd in Js translation.

XIīI.77. J's rendering of the word bgjra with diamond is the key
towards his misconception of the whole stanza, as the comparison does not ft at
all-

XIII.79a sĕḍĕṅtat. I regard it as a contraction of sĕḍĕṅtu tā;t (if you do
not), because then the counsel given by Wibhīṣaṇa which basically is attempting
to dissuade Rāwaṇa to ght Rāma, does make sense, and is in line with Sumālī>s
advice in XIV.cd apan sśṭêṅ kita mituhwa lanā; hayunta, yapwat wihaṅ niyata yan
pralayām su-Lĕṅtām (because if you follow his advice, your good fortune will remain
forever, if you are unwilling to do so then certainly Lĕṅkā will be ruined). It
should be remembered that Sumālī uses the word sĕḍĕṅ kita too.

XIII.89e khṇywā lświh saṅka ri saṅ Raghuttama- J renders it with werh/f u
niet bowen de voortrefelijke telg van Raghu (do not put yourself above the excellent off-
spring of Raghu). He inserts yourself into his translation, which makes it wrong,
but also his understanding of the word kṣywā (with a long a) does not help him
find the right rendering- hṇyuāī; in this context is the word jangankan in B1.,
which means kt alone.

XIV4d uwl ni suśakti nira hétu nikaṅ wiśwrṇṇa- J s translation is confusing,
because he could not sec the distinction between nira and nikaṅ in the context.
Sce e-g. my article °The Samaya of Bharaḍah and Kuturan'.

XIV.6cd ṇapwan lagāna rasikū yadiyan tĕka ṅké,
byaktān pṣjahṅ kita mataṅ nya tanśmbahātah.
J renders it with Of gij tegen ken optrekt of als īij hier komen, ket is duideljk etc.
Here is an example of the fault of J's translation, stated by P. in his Kapustakan
Djawi, p- 4, in which he says that because J adhercs too closely to the text, the
real mcaning is very ofken lost- 1In this case J adheres too closely to thc word
ṣapwan, which he renders with of (whether), whilst it can mean but if
760

XIV.9a Hirawakaśpuh. J remarks that the demon Hiraṇyakaśipuh is
mentioned in the ādiparwa LXV.17 as the son of Diti The Agastyaparwa also
mentioned this demon as the father of Prahlāda, the devout worshipper of
Wiṣṇu. See concerning this story in e.g. Stories of Indian Gods Ś Heroes. 1t
seems that the story of Hiraṇyakaśipuh, or more correctly that of Narasiṅha, is
also popular in Indonesia (Java), as I have seen several statues in the Museum
Pusat in Jakarta, of Narasiṅha tearing Hiraṇyakaśipuh apart.

XIV.19d tātar légo sapinatih tuwi tar patih ya (he did not want to obey
people worthy of being obeyed). J renders it with al wat hem aangeraden werd
wolgde hij niet (all counsel given to him was not followed). In my view, the
emphasis here is on who is giving counsel, because later on Kutnbhakarṇṇa raps
on it (see XXII.24-28). Wibhīṣaṇa’s lamentation also mentions this matter
(see XXIV.38).

XIV.32a huwus manĕmu suka. J renders it with ik zal geluk verwerven,
which is completely incorrect, because huwus refers to the past, while zal (shall)
refers to the future.

XIV.37d tan sinaṅsṇa. Without doubt is the literally translation. ]J's
rendering niet gewreesd (not feared) gives an adverse picture-

XIV.44c kaba-kaba. J remarks that his rendering eene kleinigheid (an
insignificant thing) is not in agreement with the dictionaries, which gives as
meaning spel or scherts (sport, game, play or joke). Pigeaud’s dictionary how-
ever on p. 157, gives as its meaning onwerschillig (indifferent, negligent, thought-
less) which in my view is appropriate in this context. The word in BI. is per-
haps gegabah.

XīV48-49. This description of a king in a fury is very well-known in the
wayaṅ-play, e-g- kumrdut pudoning laṭi, nétra ndik, jaja mawinga-winga, muka brit lir
tingpak, lamun sinabet ing merang sagantang, mesti bel mubal dahanu (see e-g. Rubinipun
Raden Śuṛjatmadja, p- 30).

XīV.50d khāh asambhawa dahat puliha tuwii J's rendering is a literally
translation. It is as if he has never seen a wayaṅ performance- If he does see
one he must recognise it as to be similar to e.g. raṅkśpa sêwu si Rama, Rawanu ora
bakal kkéwran or something like that.

X1V.55c banantêna. J renders banantên with fjne wilte stof (fne white
materiall and feels rather doubtful, as he cannot find this meaning in the
761

dictionaries. P- however thinks that bananên is an older form of walanin or
malantén, originating from Tamil wannara, Mal. benara. The Indonesian form is
binatu or penatu (S). Amalantên, P. adds further, in 5erat Jusup means to wash
(BKI.82.191) Apparently J missed this. I render banantśn with clean, in the
sense of gfṭer being washed, pure etc.

XīV.56b kaśmalāniraṅ-iraṅ maniwi-niwi. J renders it onrein en schandeljjk
is ḍienstbaarheid (ñlthy and disgraceful is subservience)- I am not sure of the
translation of Js rendering, because I cannot comprehend it fully, as it sounds
so strange. I believe that J. takes maniwi-niwi as being derived from siwi (to
serve), while in my opinion it comes from świ-iwi (to make a fool of so. to taunt,
to harass).

XIV.66-69. I cannot comment on J's translation.

XV.6b umajarakśna bhakti rasikana tĕka. J's rendering reads om zṭne
aanhankelijkheid te betuigen aan hem, die kwam (to express his devotion to him, who
came). It seems here that J- understands rasikana to be Rāma, whilst I am of
the opinion that rasikana is Wibhīṣaṇa.

XV-7c sahuripana mahārddhika tuwi gunawīn (it is certainly better to accept
him as he is noble and virtuous) 1 render sahuripana with it is certainly better to
acegpt him. The Oldjavanese author might have used this word, which is derived
from hurip (life), just in reminiscence of the original Skt. version which mentions
that some monkey-chiefö want to kill Wibhīṣaṇa, as they doubt his sincerity (See
HPS I1I.36-43, esp- p- 39-40).

XV.23a makara. I render makara as prawns, as I feel it is unlikely
that dolphins, however small would be crushed like that, because a p¥sut (bruinuis,
according to J) passes by. A porpoise is a kind of dolphin and is not much
bigger than a dolphin. See my article about makara is Relung Pustaka, Agustus,
1970. Also in the Hitopadéśa the makara is not a dolphin or crocodile, but a
crab. See Tṅe Ocean 9f Stoṛy V.48-9.

XV.37b apan lan durbbalū etc- I cannot comprehend the word tan here
as meaning not, because were it thus, then the action of Rāma in causing turmoil
in the ocean is correct, but is not supported by the text further on (see stanza
40-41). So in my view tan here should be regarded as to derive from ta
(emphasis) + n (third person) or should be read yan.
762

XV.39c uṅgwantat Wiṣṇu léki ṅ tasik etc. I render the above as follows
as Wiṣṇu, the ocean is your place- I feel that Baruṇa here giyes a hint of the
occasion when Wiṣṇu lays on the coils of Ananta at the bottom of the ṣsea during
the night of Brahmā- (See e.g- H- Zimmer, Myths and ñymbuls etc., p. 1-68, esp.
p. 31-60).

XVl13d hadi pwa paṅahg; sumārgga nikanaṅ jṣwa śrī n tśka. J regards śn
as the goddess Śrr He renders jaya śrī n teka with de ṣegewierende Śn, als zjj zou
komen (the victorious Śrī, if she would come). Usually if it is the goddess Śrī who
is meant, the author would use an honorefic particle such as saṅ, kyaṅ, déwṅ etc.
which we could not find here. Thus I think śn in this context should be trans-
lated into happiness and jgya into success or uictory.

XVI.12a saṅgari It seems that this instrument was not used very
much in times later than that of the Rāmāyaṇa, so that it is dificult to defne.
J- renders it with glasinstrument (musical instruments made of glass). As I can-
not imagine a musical instrument made of glass, I leave it as it is in the hope,
that in the future students may have seen such an instrument and be willing to
pass his knowledge on.

XVI.15a Mandāra- According to MW., p. 788 it is a mountain or name
of one of the five trees in Indra’s heaven. J. renders it with Erythrina fowers.
My rendering is in accordance with MW.

XVI.15b tumāb tśöśṅ tan olak. My rendering of the word tan olak, the
text has tamolah. is based on mss BCDE, and render it with without swgying too
stronghy as literary it means without sgualls; tĕśêṅ means obstacle- J on the other
hand reads tamolah as anulak derived from sulah which he renders with swjken
(see note no. 1).

XVI.20a ygiliṅ-giliṅ. In the notes (no. 2) J renders giliṅgiliṅ as a kind
of fish or peacock- I doubt it very much and find in MW,, p. 355, the word
gila explained as the citron tree. In NJ. there is a kind of citron-ñkuit called
Jjéruk guluṅ which is indeed very large compared with other kinds of jwuk. So
I think giliṅ-giiṅ might be derived from the Skt- gila and later on fnds its
latest form in guluṅr The lexical meaning of giliṅ and guluṅis similar- I think
that the juice of the jêruk guluṅ is indeed a sparkling drink (inuman marakatottama).

XV1.30d puḍak inalĕm. I surmise, that inal¥m is derived from in-aln
and alêm develops into the N}J. alum (to wither). The N.J. word for this kind of
rro

763

process, namely withering up fowers wrapped or placed in vessels to transport
the smell into something else, e.g., clothes, hair etc. is ĕp. J seems to under-
stand inalśm as deriving from alĕm (to praise).

XVI.30a jahri ]t is not rendered in the translation. Perhaps it refers
to the goddess/river Gaṅgā as the daughter of Jahnu. Here it is represented by
talaga. This stanza is still very freḍuently sung by the dalaṅ (puppetteer) at
around midnight, when the mood and fut¥t of the gamelan changes from ĕnĕm
(six) to saṅa (nine).

XVI.34d kinawguk < kawayuh > kayuh (to caress)  I render it with
to caress, whilst J. seems to see it as a derivation of wgyuk (to have more than one
wife.

XVI.35. I retain the Javanese words in brackets in an attempt to save
some of the beauty of the rhyme which inspired the poet to describe the
relationship between the sêusik flower in love (asś) with a bee which has
ravished (manaḍak) her beauty/love (asiñ). 1I cannot see, how J. could introduce
the taḍaṅ-usih bird here.

XVlī.3a rgjahlā. I render it with [especially blended] for rṇual use.
J. seems not to be certain. In his w.l. he renders it with naam wvan een smeersel
(name of a cream) with a guestion mark. He leaves the word uanrendered in his
translation.

XVII.l4a ya ṅ gaṅan. J reads it tuṅganan and renders it with rṭdieren
(mounts)I think the original reading is appropriate in the meaning of materials
or ingredients to be cooked. In NṛJ. jaṅun also means vegetables.

, XVI1.15d rumpwana. J seems to render the word rumpwana with laten
. dhie in sero’s gevangen worden (let them be caught in seroes). I do not know what
a sero is, but it seems that this word is meant to render the word rumpwan. In
N.J. the word for rumpwan is rumpon, which G ñR, I, p. 362 explains as een
plaats of vak in het water, waar takken ṭf struiken digt op elkaar zijn geplaats en als't
ware bosjes wormen om er de uisschen in te lokken. Na eenige tijd wordt die plaats met
bamboerwosters gfgeet en de daartusschen besloten visch, nadat de takken en struiken verwij-
derd ṛijn, met schepnetten gewangen. (A place or enclosure in a river, where
branches or undergrowth are piled up thickly, as to form bunches (or bushes?)
ṭo attract the ish. After a while the place is fenced in with bamboo gratings
and, after the branches and undergrowth are removed, are the fish trapped in-
side caught in nets). So rumpwanu is to catch fsh in that way. In my translation
I simply render it with let it be caught.
764

XVlI.34cd lalu niṣpṅala tan padon larasta paṅalah riṅ Tripuréka nirguṇa pwa.
Niṣphala (fruitless), tan padon (worthless) and nirguṇa (useless) have almost the
same meaning, in fact I regarded niṣpṅalu as the Skt. euivalent of tan padon.
Another point which I wish to put forward is, that J seems to overlook the fact
that Tripura is not slain by Wiṣṇu, but by Śiwa, and by so doing he cannot see
the relation between lurasta and line d- Line d iṣ only an adjectival phrase for
larasta. Hence my translation into: ṣour bow, the slger ṭf Tripura [lit. with
which Śiwa had slain Tripura], was worthless and useless: About the story of the
destruction of Tripura see eg- H. Zimmer, Myths and Śymbuls ec., p. 185-Ṣ. There
is a slight mistake here concerning the bow which is mentioned by Sautā.
According to the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki (HPS. I.l41), it is related that
Wiśwāmitra has made two bows one is the property of Rāmaparaśu and the
other one is the bow, used by Śiwa to slay the demon Tripura. This bow has
come down to king Janaka, as it was born together with Sītā, and is broken
in the swayaṅwara by Rāma. Rāmaparaśu gives the bow to Rāma to keep
if he is able to draw it. The bow of Rāmaparaśu is in fact the bow of
Wiṣṇu, so that it returns to its original owner, or if we consider Rāmaparaśu
as a manifestation of Wiṣṇu, the bow in fact never flls into the hands of other
people-

XVII.37b cĕṅĕl J renders it with als (neck), obviously inuenced by
the NJ- meaning of the word- On the other hand I am convinced that cêṅḍ in
this context means head, as frstly it was mentioned before that Rāwaṇaīs
attendants, on the kings orders, brought the heads of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa to be
shown to Sitā, secondly because I feel that Sītā would not especially look at the
neck of Rāma, while she then addressed Rāma (see stanza 38 s9q).

XVI1.53 astra J renders it with sckirkt (dart, arrow), whilst I traṇṣ-
late it into sword. 1In fact, astru means weapon, but the weapon Rāwaṇa
threatened to kill Sītā with before. is a sword, and Śīta in stanza 51d, only one
stanza earlier, also mentions a sword (wĕṭ)

XVI1.58b taman pakaliṅa dé nyu. J bases his translation on the
Balinese interlinear translation, which is kauṇukun. I think the Balinese
translator assumes that pakakṅu is derived from aliṅ which is unguk in Balinese,
but pakaliṅu is derived from liṅ (thought, mind, word, language, explain etc.).
Literally the phrase taman pakaliṅu ḍé nyu is it is not understood b you.

XVIī.59c sauyak¥n < sawi (a scarecrow). J renders it with werp ket hi,r
weg (throw it away). Perhaps J thinks that sawyak¥n is derived from sawyaṅk (to
765

insult). Ifit is true, then his rendering appears redundant- Why should Rāwaṇa
asks Sītī to throw the heads of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa awwy, and then later on to tkrow
them in the sewers.

XVI1.63a amrém- J seems to combine lśra with amrĕm, hence his trans-
lation into slip uast (sound asleep; deep slumber), followed by his rendering of
tan pisan kapati (in line b) into niet ineens in āwjjm (not suddenly unconscious)-
Instead I render âbra with oul 9f grif, amrkm with to go to bed and tan pisan kapati
with could not sleek.

XVII.64b mumik- J's rendering into er was niemand, die iets prevelde
(there was nobody who muttered anything), is a literally renderingṛ The N}].
euivalent of mumik in this context is perhaps mobah mosik (moving and talking).
Hence my translation into nobody moved a muscle-

XVII.67b apa tud wulat i ṅwaṅ. J's rendering is a literally one.
The meaning is, that Sītā feels that the Supreme Deity never pays attention to
her.

XVI1I.70-72. I cannot follow Js translation.

XVII.85a Muntharākśñy (called Manthara): In the RK there is no clue
whatsoever that Manthara means anything else but the mountain Mandara.
The Bhatṭṭikāvya, translated by Leonardi, does not mention this name and this
episode of the RK,, Sītā/s resolve to die in the pyre, is not found in this book.
Should it be regarded as an indication that, beside the Bhaṭṭikāvyam, the Old-
javanese author had also other books/versions of Rāmāyaṇa at his disposal?
For sure there are many other parts which can be regarded as indications of
this kind, but in this particular episode we see that the author seemed to be at
his wit’s end, and made an error, very clumsily hidden, even behind a mountain
as big as the Mandara. Is there perhaps a part taken out after the words Hunu
Mantharākya, or is there something inserted in this place? I feel sure that
Manthara is the name of the hunch-backed maid of Kékayī, and that somehow,
someone had inserted her name but seemed to have forgotten what she was and
what role she played in the story- See also Introduction.

XVII85d kasgy, pususin In Java kasgy (face-cream) is made from rice-
flour mixed with other ingredients, such as curcuma, sandalwood etc. The
ingredients are crushed up together in a grinding-plate made of stone (pipisan)
with some water. When it is completely blended and very fne it is made into
766

balls and dried up in the sun. Sometimes, if the size of the balls are big, they
are flattened with the thumb to speed the drying processs When it is dry, it
is stored in bottles, mixed with some dried owers (see note of XVI.30d puduk
inalém)- When one wants to use it, it can be easily crushed on the palm of the
hand, or made into a cream with some water.

Pususśn. Kernīs text has pupusĕn, which puzzled J. My reading is based
on mss ABCDE. The meaning is to grind or to crush.

XVI1.86cd. J is not certain of his translation, as he adds guestion marks.
I think the words that puzzle him are lumĕkas derived from lĕkas (action,
to do) and war¥g (satisñed, tired, bored), which he renders with verṛadigd (satis-

fed).

XVlI.śṢb 2ya ṅ gurun < guru-kn. I render it with pgy great attention to,
based also at the Indonesian phrase ambil bérat, which means to give weight to
s.t. J renders it with w (fat), with a guestion mark, but later on regards the
meaning of gurun as solved by the explanation of kanaka manik - geurig smeersel
(fragrant cream). Js note no. l. See also note on stanza 92.

XVI11.90d aṅ¥n-aṅ¥nśn < aṅ¥n-aṅ¥n-śn. J seems to overlook the sufñx
-śn (imperative futurum passive) in this context, which explains his faulty

rendering.

XVII.92b kanaka maṇik (golden jewel). J renders it with geurig smeersel
(fragrant cream). and sounds very satisfied with himself (see his note, no. 1). To
me, his translation is very diffcult to follow, e.g. lines ab are rendered as follows:
de ṛalf van den god vlamde ṛeer snel op; toen werd hij vereerd met een geurig smeersel.
Questions like: what cream (talf), who is the deity (god), who is ke (hṭ) etc.
loom up with no clear solutions. Even his notion that kanakadrauu is a kind of
kanakamanik is really a daring conclusion, because kanakadrawau in the Arjuna-
wiwāha is not a kind of offerings dish. It is better to guote it fully. Arj. XXIII.
4d digdāha kahiḍĕpanikān ginandha kanakadrawa makabharaṇa (translation by P. me
gedreven goud als gewicht ṛagen ze eruit gelijk hemelbrand —with chased gold as weight
they looked like the sky on fire). I would translate the phrase as follows: framed
with embossed gold with ornaments they looked us if faming. 1I prefer to render kanaka
maṇik with golden jewel, meaning the offerings fre. I may even claim the support
of the phrase in the Arjunawiwāha above, as the kanaku there implics also

digdāha (like burning).
767

XVIl93b déwawuktra. That J renders waktra with geluut (face) is a
puzzle to me. I think it is just an unfortunate choice. I prefer to render it with
mouth, as the offerings fire is usually regarded as the mouth of the deity
worshipped by the devotee.

XVI193c bhaktawatsala. J renders it with werzot op eten (fond of eating).
I do not know whether gluttenous is a virtue to be ascribed to the Supreme
Deity, but even for human beings it is not praiseworthy. MW, p. 743, gives for
bṅakta: faithful and watsala (on p. 916): loving, tender, kind. Hence my
translation.

XVI1.96a Bhawra. This reading is based on ms- A. Though all
other mss I use read Bhāmrata, I think that it is a mistake of the copyist who
might have been inuenced by the name of Rāma’s younger brother, and son
of Kékayr That Bhārata is an epithet of Agni, as J explains in his note, is not
very convincing to me, as I doubt whether it is known in Java because it seems
to be very rare- Secondly, the deity worshipped by Sītā here is not Agni, but
Śiwa, as seen in stanza 94, just two stanzas earlier. It is true that Śiwa is oen
identifed as Śiwagni (Śiwa, the Firegod), but jt is not always correct to identify
Agni with Śiwa.

XVI1.99. Stanzas 92-99 contain the prayer of sSrtā to Śiwa. To me they
sound like the hymns of the Upaniṣads and I believe that further and deeper
study in this direction might bring satisfactory results and might open a new
horizon. For the information of heedful students, this part is not found either
in the Bhaṭṭikāwyam or the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki.

XVlII.100a prgyṣara. I render it with prgwers, in regard to the fore-
going, J. however renders it with réên (cause), bringing about divergency in the
translation of the line.

XVI1.106c tan kagunĕman. I render it with beond description which I
find more appropriate than the literal translation of J into wordt nooit gesproken
(never spoken about).

XVI1.107d mĕnĕṅa manah nira. It seems that J. confuses the word
mśn¥ṅ, derived from um¥nśṅ < um-ĕnĕṅ (come to rest), with monĕṅ (yearning) as
he renders the above phrase with zou uerlangend worden in iṭjn hart (would be
yearning in his heart).

XVIī1.108d mata dkūrtta saṅ Maduna. J's rendering of mata with ṣe and
dkurita with sk does not appear to be ftting to me. I think in this phrase mata
means mad, derived from mutta (see MW p. 777).
768

XVI1.111b maṅkin ikā manah ṇya magiraṅ saharṣaja kabèh. The words
ikā, nya and ṇu do not refer to Sīā, as Js translation suggests. Thcy refer to
the ladies in waiting, who are playing in the rays of the full moon. See the
difference between ika, ya etc. with ira, nira in my article *The samaya of
Bharaḍah and Kuturan.

XVlI.l12a magawé ta junti The word junli is derived from juii (MW
p. 424), meaning velocity game. In N.J. it is called jéuṅan or jéuṅan.

b. sĕmut pupul. It might be the Javanese jamuran or lĕpĕtan, also a velocity
game. Though performed with songs etc. it seems to be different from that
which is mentioned in Kromīs article Muziekmaken in de Maneschijn.

c. paṅisi I must admit, though reluctantly, that J might be correct in
reading paṅasi instead of paṅisi, based on one of the ms, which I connot verify, as
J does not identify the ms. I become a bit suspicious here, because in many
cases J always bases his reading on his sharp intellect or other sources, such as
the KBW etc., but never on the original mss, e.g. when he remarks on stanza
135 of sarga V1I1, he only says that perhaps the numbering is faulty. If he has
a ms(s) in front of him, he might find the fault then. As all the mss I use have
the same reading, paṅisi, I have no choice but to adhere to it. Besides. I have
also some doubt because paṅusi or paṅasik is a kind of love potion, and the text
enlists names of cookies and snacks. I prefer to consider those kinds of snacks
wrapped in banana-leaves which in NJ. are called kĕĕman. One should unwrap
the leaves first to come to the contents(isi).

d. bubur carana. 1 cannot sce how J. could render carana with eker in
bladeren gewikkeld gebak (certain cookies wrapped in leaves). The construction of
the word combination bubur carana reminds me of a kind of porridge sold by
vendors from door to door, mostly at night, in my home-town Surakarta in
Central Java. G ñ R I, p- 258 explains caraṇa as originating from racaṇu (Skt)
meaning ornament. If this compound-word bubur caraṇa is in fact bubur racaṇa,
then it might be that kind of porridge, usually served in a takir pontaṅ (a kind of
box made of pleated young coconut leaves). For offering purposes the takir
ponṭaṅ is made very small.

XVl5.l130 makin lalāsa. J renders it with lalāsa-stof (lalāsa-material).
In my view lalmsu is perhaps the alus-alasan pattern of batik which up to now is
only used or worn by court ladies, and brides and grooms on certain occasions.
Dukula is a kind of plant, or name of a very fine cloth or raiment made of the
769

inner bark of this plant (M.W. p. 483). So I am of the opinion that the girls
are wearing kains (skirts) with alas-alusan motif, while the upper garment is made
of red dukālu-material. As the kain with alas-alasan motif is usually blue-black
in colour, red is probably regarded as the contrasting colour (tulalṣ < tul).
Concerning this pattern, see *Dodot Banguntulak>, in Relung Pustaka, Djuli
1970, pp- 36-9, esp- the picture on the back-page cover.

XVlI.l13c. The word rarṇ is rendered by J. with knapen (boys). I really
cannot understand J's reasoning, how he could imagine to find boys in the
harem-like garden of Lĕṅkā.

XVII.ll4c wyṇadi magĕṅ w¥tĕṅ nya kawayar. In NJ. that kind of disease,
which causes a swollen stomach, is called kśmbuṅ (see G ĕ R I.546) and is
due to cold or flu, whilst kawgyan is perhaps the onme called Lṣdr (see G ñ R,
J.704) which might be the effect of being kś¥mbuṅ. 1I do not think that it can be
rendered as waterāucht (dropsy) as is done byJ- According to E.C. Horne’s
Javanese-English Dictionayy, p. 73, kèĕr is explained as a pathological compulsion to
urinate freuently, whilst dropṣy is a disease in which watery fwid collects in cavities or
tissues 9f body (The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, p- 368).

XVlIn.129d pucarĕṅga. J notes that he cannot find the meaning of the
word pacarśṅga in the KBW., but in fact G & R1I1.209 gives the meaning
pacarêṅga = pacar baṇyu (a kind of balsam).

XVII.135-137. This is a difficult part which needs deep consideration. Is
there in fact a woman captive in the Aśoka-garden besides Sītā. It seems very
improbable, and this view makes J assume that stanzas 135-137 are the words of
Ṣītā. Against this notion plead the third personal pronouns in line d, st. 135
which reads nakan ta liṅ ṇṇa, and line g, st. 138 which reads ya ta ikana wuwus
nyāwanta etc. The sufñx nya in both lines certainly cannot, refer to Sītā, as in
line c, st. 138 Sītā is referred to with sira dkwi, and in line d with satatu tu sira
śoka etc. In the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki (HPS III.81-83) the only person
addressing Sītā is Sarama, whose role in the RK is partly taken over by her
daughter, Trijaṭā. However Rāwaṇa is also known as an abductor of women
kept captive in Lĕṅkā besides Sītm.

XVIIl.2a Suka Śaraws. M]any students of the RK, including J., believe,
that Suka-Śaraṇa in the kakawin is only one person, as in the case of the N.]J.
versions of the Rāma-story. This belief seems so widespread so that no further
thought has been given to it, but a closer study reveals that this assumption does
770

not stand on a sound foundation. In XVIII.13a Suka-Śaraṇa refer to themselves
in plural form as follows: mahārāja, kamtkiken kinonkon etc. Tīhe word kami
usually indicates the plural form, rather than singular. Even ]J. translates it
into wjj (we). There is still other conclusive evidence, that is XVIlII.22, which
reads nihan ta taṅguh mami kārwa yalap¥n (so, take the advice of both of us). The
word kārwa (both), though the most decisive evidence so far, has been hidden
from sight for so long. (See further note on XV1II.22b).

XVIIī.3d wĕnaṅomaṭyathauīū yathāsukūtāt. The metre forces the poet to
spell the sandi between umāṭo and athawū with a shorta. For this reason, it
seems, J. reads it wĕnaṅa umāti athawā yatāsukātūt and renders it with om in staut
te jjn, hem te dooden 9f als hij dit wenschte, ich met hem te verṛoenen [to be also to
kill him (Rāwaṇa) or whether he wishes to reconcile with him (Rāwaṇa)]. In
view of Wibhīṣaṇa’s remarks in the council, that Rāwaṇa has lost Sugrīwa for
ever, I tend to believe that Rāwaṇa wants to test Wibhīṣaṇaīs remarksi Hence

my translation.

XVIlI1.9d ṇadiyan patyana yan mapa gatinya (to be sentenced to death or
whatever it may be) In my opinion this line is part of Wibhīṣaṇa's speech.
On the other hand J seems to include this line in the speech of Rāma in stanza
10, based on the absence of closing ḍuotation marks at the end of the translation
of stanza 9- I have to admit that I become confused here, as at the end of
Wibhīṣaṇa's speech no closing guotation mark is found- Is it a fault in the
print or is it deliberate, because J- is not sure of it himself Logically this line
belongs with the other three preceding lines. but with J's rendering which reads
Pan welk belang zou ket Zijn, als hij gedood werd (What would be the beneft, if he
is brought to death?), one may get the impression, that Wibhīṣaṇa wants to
save Suka-Śaraṇa, which is not true, as can be seen in the report of Suka-Śaraṇa
to Rāwaṇa, found in XVIII.21.

XVII1.löab umulik ikanaṅ gunuṅ kodi lwak, ikaṅ sāgara tulya parwwatāwān
(the mountains turn into valleys, and the ocean turns into high mountains). J
admits that he does not understand these lines clearly- I think, because he
renders lwah with water and umulik with to return, he creates an incredible picture
which confuses him-

XVII1.22b *arwa yālapên- As always,J seems not to bother that his
translation creates confusion for the reader. In regard to Suka-Śaraṇa, ārst he
regards them as one person and renders it as singular in stanzas 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
771

9, 10, 11, 12, then as plural in stanzas 13, 21. In stanzas 22 etc- he returns to
singular again. Now in the above phrase he creates a problem with his trans-
lation which reads neem die beide aan (take both of them). What does he mean
with the word both? T understand that the advice of Suka and Śaraṇa is only
one, that is to return Sitā to Rāma- Everything then becomes alright. So
everything good or bad is only the result of whether Sitā is returned or not. For
me the word kāruu is the clearest indication that Suka and Śaraṇa are two
persons. See note on XVIII.2a.

XV1I1I1.31c jśāwara (hunter). See note about the Śabara-woman hermit
(VI9a). Also J. Gonda, ‘Tumura’s en Gavara’y BKī. 90(1933). Hooykaas
note on the ‘Old Javanese Kakawin and the Śabaras¹, contains no new infor-
mation (ĕkī 113, 1957).

XVIlI1.37b mahawan tatambak. I render it with jumping over the walls, as
I am of the opinion that the Javanese poet might have in mind the walls that
ring the city of Lĕṅkā. Aṅgada surely cannot go through the main gate or the
main street (lśbuk agêṅ), as they will be guarded very closely. J- on the other
hand renders it with betrad den dam, which is ambiguous.

XVIlII.44a sakāntukānaṅguhi The text of K. and also the other mss
reads sakotukānaṅguki, which does not make sense. See J's remark in his note.

X\VI1lI.45d rumāg taṅ dharmmāgöṅ mawara-warah iṅ wtṇya balawān. I
render it with: He talks about the power of dignily, while he himself is the destroyer of
the greatest dignil (dharmma) In my opinion this line is then expounded by
Rāwaṇa in the next stanza- ]Jṛs rendering does not give that relationship, as it
reads Hij owertreedt de grootste plicht, door een dappere held te vermanen (he trespasses
the greatest obligation by giving counsel to a courageous hero) The last part
refers to Rāwaṇa himself, so that it appears contradictory to the following
stanza.

XVIlI1.46d guru drohakāṭantéṅ kanaraka ikṅ wānara lumud (You, ape, be-
trayer of teachers, will go to hell. J's rendering reads Hjj beleedigt ijn lee-
ymeester en is uitermate slecht, tengewolge daarvan, dat hij een aap is. (he insults
his teacher, and is utterly bad, with the conseḍuence that he becomes an ape).

XVlIII.47a tatan wis (unlimited, without limit). Hence my translation
into you are bad through and through. The mss, including K. read tatan pistawuk.
J's rendering, based on the meaning of the word pista in Sundanese seems to be
far-fetched to me.
772

XVII1.49a dula sabhgya. The literally meaning of this phrase is thr
messenger who brings fear, the dangerous messenger. My rendering is tke fear-inspiring
messenger. J's rendering, scheldende op den beureesden geṛant. I would assume that
scheldende op den gevreesden geṛant would be more appropriate, and not contra-
dictory to his own translation of the following stanza which reads: Duurop
keerde hjj (Aṅgadu) terug, onbewreesd (Thereupon he went back, without fear) See

XVlIII.50a.

X1X.4d praharaṇa kalikm. M.W. indicates that it is the name of several
metres, which is of course not ñtting in this context. J. states that it refers to
prahareṇa kuliśa in stanza 3d, with which I partly agree. Kuliśa is an are, arrow
while kalikām (M.W. p. 277) is a kind of heron. In Old Javanese and N.J.
literature there is mention of arrows or weapons in the shape of birds, which in
the shadowplay is usually depicted as an arrow with the head of a bird. See
e.g. AgasWa in den Archipel, p. 18 ñ 19, esp. note no. 1. Hence my translation
into striking weapons.

XIX.7b struwwadha. My reading is based on mss. ABCD. K s reading
is strṭ paḍa which might be based on ms. E., which renders J's translation incon-
gruous. This part is not mentioned in the translation of the BK by Leonardi,
but I think the fear of Rāwaṇa for this strwwadka originates from the curse of
Nalakuwéra, after Rāwaṇa had raped the nymph Rambhā, because Nalakuwéra
said: 6©Rāwaṇa has used force upon you against your will, henceforward if he
uses force upon any woman against her will, his head will instantly burst into
pieces>. See Makhan Lal. Sen, BL, The Ramṣan, Il1.315-16. See also HPS.

IT1.465-7.

XIX.13d makāsaāra. J remarks that according to J. Kunst, Hinde-
Javaansche muziek instrumenten, p. 81, mahgsāru is the name of a gong. Since aṅsi
already means gong, and mardala and paṭaṅa are types of drums (see Js w.l), I
cannot agree with J's remark and understand makāsāra simply as a compound
of makū (great) ṭ- sāra (strength, strong). Hence my translation into very

strongh-

XīX.17a maswaṅga. J renders it with gewesten (hilts), and notes that
this is the appropriate meaning in this context, not kleedingstuk (article of clothing).
M-W. p. 1277 renders swaṅga with own limb. I feel that uniform in this context
Wwould be the suituble rendering.
p4 773

XJX.18. This description is a stereotyped one in the scene of the
marching out of the army in the shadowplay even today- See e.g. Rabinipun R.
śuṛyatmaḍja, p. 20-1.

XIX.19-32. The farewell scenes seem to give the reader the impression
that the demons will be slain in battle, e.g. the drinking of liguor, sexual inter-
course before going to war, heart-breaking scene while parting etc.

XIX.22b mapwgy-pway somya saśn wulat wa. J renders mapwgy-pwṇy
with stralend (radiant[ly]), based on the translation of Aichele lieblich strahlend. 1f
this were true, then it is in total contrast with line a which reads molm maṅlik,
rendered by J with kwṭnend en afgemut (languished and worn out). How could
someone who is languished and worn out be radiant If we go further to line
d, then we have that same person mamrik lumaku ya kumĕ¥r tur nya, mapśs w¥tisṇwa
rendered by J with trachtten zṭ te logpen, (maar) hare knieen knikken en hare beenen
waren ṛwak (thg attempted to walk, but their knees shook and their legs were feble). How
could such a person be radiant ?

I think mapwgy-pway develops into its N.J. form in the word por or pyoh.
Pigeaud’s dictionary p. 478, gives kaporan as uitg¢put (worn out), whilst G  R.
ī1.215, gives apor as slap in leden (weak in the limbs). For the word pokê, G &
R. I1.320 gives as explanation een plotseling gewoel van āwakheid en onmacht door een
schokkende aandoening (a sudden feeling of weakness and inability caused by a
disturbing mental impression). I believe the renderings given by Pigeaud
and GC ñ R ft exactly with the description of stanza 22.

XIX.34a udurèṅ raṇa. The literal translation is gluttonous in fghting.
Hence my translation into veṛy good at fghting. J's rendering is wus de buik (het
centrum) in den strijd (was the stomach (the centre) of the battle). Here again J's
translation is bristling with contradictions. Ghatṭodhara’s post is in the south,
together with Mahāpārśwa, Prahasta is in the east, while Meghanāda’s
troops are in the west and north. Assuming that the enemy comes from the
ṇorth, then Ghaṭodhara is the rearguard. The poet is playing with words here,
the word udāra is used because it rhymes with Ghaṭodhara.

XIX.350 wataṅun. J renders it with uergaderṣual (audience-hall). I
do not believe the soldiers are within the audience-hall, but outside in the royal
sguare.

XIX.43a binabak ṇya tan pāhu ya. ] render it with were broken ṇf śy them
without difcully, because I assume that tan pal is the NJ. ors pati (not very
774

[diffcult]). J is not sure of his translation which reads werden dwor hun afgebroken
onder einde (were broken off by them endlessly).

XIX.44a Kuśala. I regard it as a proper name, the name of the
mother of Rāma. J renders it with om ṛṭn keil te bewerken (to bring about his
welfare).

XIX.4ba tiś; ri harśpan nira. I render it with coming from the other
side..... fell in front 9f him...... , whilst Js rendering reads woor hkem vielen (in front
of him fell). The difference I want to put forward is, that everything mentioned
after these words comes from the side of the demons.

XIX48d pamyi. J renders it with gunstige uitlegging (favourable inter-
pretation), with the remark that it is the most suitable rendering in the context.
I prefer to translate it into prediction, based on the fact that puji has also the
connotation of prayer, hope or any mental condition to sustain hope.

XIX.57. I cannot follow J's translation, and therefore cannot judge
whether it is an alternative rendering to mine.

XIX.58d wĕnaṅ śumikṣāṅ sarāt. The word śumikṣa derived from śikṣa is
rendered by J with bekeersen (to control, to dominate, to rule). I render it with to
impart knowledge to .., because the poet wants to explain that Rāma is so wise he
can teach even the apes, who by nature are thoughtless and dumb. Also the
lexical meaning of śikṣa is to learn or to teach (see MW, p. 1070).

XIX. 59a jutiṅ. The word gutiś in this context does not mean patih
(prime minister) as the translation of J suggests, but it means obedient, like the
word patih or patuṅ in B.I.

XIX.62a kobkṇan (imminent). J renders it with dreigend (threatening,
imminent) but remarks that he is not sure of his translation. C  R. I.196-7
explains that ubhgya = tijdsbepaling, bepaling van een ṭekere thjd waarop éets 2al plaats
hebben (a fixed time; the fixation of a certain time whereupon something will
happen). For the word imminent, the Concise Oṛford Dictionayy, p. 593 gives
the following explanation: (of events, esp. dangers) impending, soon to
happen. I believe the rendering of kobkṇwn with imminent is herewith fully
justifed.

XIX.68a kahundulu (bulging out). J notes that his translation of the
word kahundula into aansluiten (to join, to link up) is not certain. 1I render it
with slighll akead. based on the meaning of the N.J. word ondul-ondul, which iṣ
oppuilen (bulging out). See G & R. ].33.
775

XIX.7lc laṅgala (weapon in the form of a plough). This weapon is
still known in the Javanese shadowplay as the weapon of Balarāma. It is a kind
of lance with a hook, looking like the aṅkuśa (a hook for elephant>s drivers) J
renders it with ploegijzers (ploughshare).

XIX.73. The translation of J resembles the battle itself, confused and
senseless.

XIX.75b mamrékśst.. J remarks that the meaning given in the
dictionaries for mamrĕkêskt (wringen = wring, twist, writhe) does not fāt the con-
text and renders it with besprongen (to pounce on). I think to twist (the necks
of the demonṣ) is suitable. This way of killing enemies is still well-known
in the shadowplay today and is usually ascribed to Ghaṭotkaca, the super-hero
son of Bhīma.

XIX.79. I think J is in trouble with his translation here and at other
parts, because he uses the plural form, e.g. in the frst two lines of this stanza.
Whilst grammatically it is not incorrect, the picture created is somewhat arti-
fcial, e.g. like in dance, where a group of monkeys and a group of demons were
doing the same movements in accordance with the gamelan and rhythm. I pre-
fer to picture war-scenes like this as performed by the dalaṅ, e.g. one monkey
against one demon in seuence. Though performed in this way, the reader or
ṭhe onlooker still gets the impression that the actions are taken simultaneously
and on the same battle feld.

¥IX.84. Concerning the reading of kitu into hita and mutu into muta, see
my article titled The word tgji in the Rānāyaṇa Kakawin>, in Studies in Indo-Asian
4r and Culture, vol. I(1972).243-52. See also my alternative translation of this
stanza in the same article.

XṛX.87b hgywa hnu (let it not be in disgrace). J seems to disregard

the meaning of kgwu (do not, let it not be) but sees it as a derivation of ṅwu,
(goede; schoone), and produces a hardly conceivable translation.

XIX.91c pamśrĕr. The base-word is pĕn¥r (straight). The literally
translation of pamknêr rya is the straight way that leads to it.

X[īX.95b ṅuni-ṅuni (moreover). J's rendering of the word ṅuni-ṅuni with
yroeger (formerly) is totally incorrect. Nuṅi is the word that means formerh.

īīX.97d asiṅata sādkyū ni?ata kasiddha. Literally the translation should
be: fbut] if there is a will, surely [everything] will be obtained.
776

XIīX.100. Js translation has no sense at all.

XIX.101d imudhahaṇwa. J understands it as derived from uduk which
is guite wrong, because the base-word is uḍkani (conscious). This form can be
found again in XXIV.46c mudhaṇyana munah nikaṅ duṛjjana. ]J does not com-
prehend this line correctly either, since he analyzcs it into muda-ṇyana(è) (dwaus-
heid= foolnesṣ).

XIX.105a gĕélanékaṅ mārkka. J seems to render gelana with uilgeput
(exhausted), whilst I render it with to be in trouble.

XIX.115ab lāgi lkkasan. ] is puzzled by these words, because he does
not read further. The reading should be lāgi lukus an kasanmata ctc. Luĕkasan is
joined in this line, because of the application of the yamaka.

XīX.120c katubab iṅ tśpk (to fall against the banks...... ). J follows Van
der Tuuk's faulty reading, who takes tubabiṅ as the base-word.

XIX.127c maṅasulāsa liṅa. J remarks that the word ulāsa cannot be
found in the dictionaries and proposes to read it as ulā saliṅu. I would read it
as maṅasula-asa-liṅa, maṅasula is derived from the secondary base-word kasula,
which in turn is derived from sulu (or śula).

XIX.129a sawanêk t-gjar sakawênaṅ. I render it with nothing else could
be seen, though literally it should be nothing else could be said. ]J is puzzled by
the word ṭgjur and notes that Van der Tuuk explainsit as papacĕk(=beṛeerd—
wounded), hence his translation. j

XIX.131a cĕṅĕé ikanaṅ prawtwa pinugut umulat malélu. I cannot under-
stand J's translation which reads: De halwen der helden, dir ṭfgesneden waren, keken
uitpuilend. 1I do not dare to translate it even.

XX.8ab b/gjru. The word bgjra occurs twice, once in each linṇe. J
renders both with diamant (diamond). I hold the view that here the poet wants
to play with words, so although using the same word, he has two meanings in
his mind, namely steel and weapon. I do not use diamond because usually the
material used in manufacturing weapons is stel, not diumond.

XX.9b mwo tiba mo kasuṅsaṅ. I understand mo as moṅ in N.J. meaning
do not want. In another context mo seems to mean to wan, as in the B.I muu. In
Oldjavanese words which have two opposite meanings are freuently found, e.g.
arddha can mean weṇ, but also kalf or slighlly, yaya can mean perhaps as wel] aṣ
certain(ly)- J’s rendering is very difñcult to explain.
777

XX.12d yan mèh prgptā ṅ pāda niṅ wwil Prajaṅgha. I understand the
situation as follows. Prajaṅgha is using his leg as a weapon, while Sampgāti (the
monkey) is armed with a club. So, when Prajaṅgha’s “weapon> comes near,
as a matter of course, Sampāti evades it. ]J. does not see the significaṇce of the
story of Prajaṅgha’s legs because he thinks the legs are comparable to a diamond,
thus a kind of jewel.

xx. 15a yaky, J regards the word dakṣa as a  proper. name, thus
according to him, there are three demons mentioned here, but if we read further
where both Sphuṭadakṣi and Pratapanākṣi were killed (st. 19), there is no
mention of Dakṣa, which means there is no demon of that name. Likewise, with
Drĕṣṭiwiṣa. Both words, dakṛa and dr¥ṛṭiwiṣa, are the faculties of Sphuṭadakṣi
and Pratapanākṣi, who are dexterious and have poisonous glances, meaning that
their glances can harm.

XX.17c sira Bahnitanga apy sakala (he was the son of god Bahni and a
manifestation of fre). My reading is based on the story that the gods have
descended to earth in order to assist Wiṣṇu, who incarnates as Rāma to kill
Rāwaṇa. The N.J. version of the descent of the deities to earth in the form of
monkeys is very amusing but unfoitunately, not freuently performed as a
shadowplay. Perhaps it is rather embarrassing to the gods and the Javanese
feel rather remorseful about it. Anyway the stories of the Rāmāīyaṇa
are not very freḍuently shown as a shadowplay performance in the region of
Surakarta.

XX.35a ri saṅ Indrgjit. J assumes that ri has its ordinary meaning
as a preposition, but in fact ri saṅ here originates from ra saṅ (honorefix particle).
In N.J. poems ri saṅ is spelt as one word, as is still freguently found.

īX.38. The defeat of Indra can also be found in the Uttarakāṇḍa. See
eg. M.L. Sen, Tke Ramgyan I11.317-8.

XX.52c padiwāharan. The reading above is based on mss- BCDE. K’s
reading is padéwāgaran. I am doubtful which to choose, as padéwāharan means
a place to bring ṭfering to the gods, whilst padkwāgaran means the house 9f the gods. ]J.
remarks that the word déwāgaru is not found in the dictionaries- If he looks
for agara in M.W., p.4, he will ñnd that dśwāgāru is synonymous with déwagrĕha
(temple). Considering that Indrajit's temple is in fact not a building, but a
sacrifcial ground called Nikumbha or Nikumbhila, I choose padéwĕharan. (See
M.W. p. śḍ).
778

XX.53. All the weapons and might of Indrajit were obtained when
Indrajit made sacrifices to Mahéśwara at the Nikumbhila sacrificial ground. See
M.L. Sen, Tṅ Ramṇun, p. 313-4.

XX.62d rtuha sawaṅśapatra patita ṅ hati Ja ta kumĕlśr (their hearts trembled
like a bamboo-leaf foating in the air). J. renders it with alsṭf het op reet
gavallen was, sidderde hun hart (as if falling on a reed, their hearts trembled). I
think the comparison in J's translation is not apparent.

XX.64b mêh kami bhoga. J renders mṅṅ with bjna (almost) which is
completely incorrect- The word mêṅ is the active form of the verb wêk (to give).
Hence my translation.

XX.69b tan hana śakti iriṣu (it has no strength).  J seems to read sakta
(fondness, attachment) instead of śaksi (power, strength, might).

XX.78b uagoṛṭi. J translates the word agoṣṭi into beraadslagen (to hold
counsel). I do not think that it is the correct rendering as it does not fit with
the following lines, in which they have a great feast and sex orgy. SNo I prefer
to render the word agoṣśi with to give a banguet. Besides, throughout the story
it is apparent that the demon soldiers, even the high-ranking offcers do not like
councilss Finally I would like to put forward a guotation from the kakawin jt-
self, namely: II.14b, as follows: yāṅtsn paḍakya nikanaṅ maninum magoṣṭi (it is like
the music of those people drinking and chatting). Kern renders it with men gou
het kunnen houden woor de muṇick van wir in gekelschap cen idrinkgelag houden (one can
take it as the music of those who with friends hold a drinking-bout).

XXI4d taṅan akwaṅ J says that his translation, kure handen waren
wersthjfd (her arms were stiff), is based on Ks notes in G ñ R dictionary. 1I
think K is correct, J does not need tobe doubtful in this case. Poerbatjaraka
in one of his lectures, which I attended as a student, explained that the NJ. form
of akwaṅ or makwaṅ is mĕk¥ṅk¥ṅ (stiff ).

XXI6bc hulunta. J renders it with uw hoṇḍW (your head), obviously
thinking that kuluntu is derived from kulu (head) + nta (your), instead of ṅuluṇ
(servant, slave, maid) 4- ta (your).

XX1I.8c ndi paran [n]i taku+-]a (where has your fear gone). Apparently
J has regarded ndi paran as synonymous with aparan (what), which is not
correct.
779

XXI.10c kita ramā kitadidéwataṅtu. J regards the word rāmu here as a
proper name, which puzzles me. I do not think Trijaṭā would regard Sitā as
Rāma (Sītī's husband), and in my view ramu in this context should be seen as a
derivative of ra-amu (father).

XXI.lla paṅ¥anaṅku. J incorrectly renders it with kult door mjj
beschermd worden (would be protected by me), while the correct rendering should
be my matron, my r¢fuge etc.

XXJ.l6a dḍéiṅ. J renders it with opende hare ogen niet (did not open her
eyes). Apparently he confuses déiṅ with dâḍṅ (to see). G ñ R. I.596 explains
d¥iṅ as ujer, wap (to say). Hence my translation.

XXIJ.22a anéka taṅwré. J renders it with uerscheidene apen (several apes)
which is not in accordance with the story, because in the story it is not only
seweral apes, but all ṇfthem. So the translation should be not owe tke apes. I
render it with the monkgs......maṇy times.

XXI.29. My translation differs very much from J's, but I cannot explain
the differences.

XXI.34a bśṅaṅ- J's translation reads hkaar mond stond open (her mouth
was open), apparently based on the meaning of the word bĕṅaṅ which he under-
stands as bśṅgaṅ (to split, to crack). As that state (mouth open, eyes cast down,
etc.) has been mentioned in the preceding stanza, I look for another solution. In
N,J. there is a word bśṅoṅ or biṅuṅ (dumbfounded) which I believe to be the
younger form of the word bśṅaṅ here. See G ñ R I1773. The N.J. meaning of
the word béṅaṅ is syphilis.

XXI.4lbc ta molah. ] translates lines b and c as follows: Ongfgebroken
bewogen zich hare verslapte handen. Onbewegdljk sloot īṭj hare oogen......... Wihile in
line c, J says bewogen (moved), in line d, he says onbewegeljś (not moving). How
can Śītā be moving her hands while she is not moving. This kind of discrepancy
very ofken lead to misunderstanding. In some cases it is not Js fault, as he
allowed himself to be led astray by the poet, who plays with the meaning of the
words.

XXI.44a tuntun ni huripku ithe one guiding my life).
J. renders it with de draad van mijn lewen (the thread of my life)
c. tuha bandhara (like a rope tight[ly]).
780

J. renders it with als een touw en een bund (like a rope and a
band).

d. mataṅ ṛya tan hilaṅa (so that it cannot get lost).

J. renders it with waardoor ik niu stiṇf (the reason why I am not
dead).

These differences in approach and understanding produce the most diver-
gent translations.

XXI.51d agéṅ pwa harṣa ṇya mawaīs ta yan [n]aluh (if they are too happy,
clearly they are near their downfall). J. apparently sees in n aluk, into which he
renders hjj overwonnen is (he was defeated), the n (personal pronoun of the third
person, sing. or plural) referring to Rāma. I rather believe that n here refers to

the demons.

XXI.53d tamak [kJanturé kita (ī too will not stay behind). J. translates
the phrase into dan ṛal ik niet bljuen bj u, rouwe (then I will not stay with you,
my lady). If]J is correct then there is no truth in Trijaṭā's words that ĕSīā is her
wishing-tree, her temple etc. I firmly believe that J's translation does not find
support in the text.

XXI.55d waṅśasthiti. J renders the word waṅśa with bamboehuis (bamboo
house), because he is apparently influenced by the name of the metre. In fact
the word wañśasthiti while referring to the metre waṅśastha, means the condition
of a family. See MW, p. 910. Hence my translation.

XXI.64a hanu kari gamaṇu bkaāra Rama pśjuhu...... J renders gamaṇā
with redmiddel (means to deliver). MW on p. 348 gives the meaning of the word
as gamaṇua a.o. foot-marks. Hence my translation into a sign or something that
leads to.

XXI.65a upahatā. Apparently J reads it as upahantawyu instead of
upahata, hence his rendering with gedwd ṛou worden (will be killed). See MW.
p. 211 for upakata and p. 212 for upahkantauya.

XXI.85d ratoddhata. J renders it with uigelaten uan ureugde (elated
with joy). I regard ratoddhsta as being composed of rata (joy) 4- uddhata (anger,
sorrow). Hence my translation into joy and sorrow. On the other hand there is
a possibility that the poet had in mind the word rudita which means sorrow,
because the N.]J. word is rudatin (See G ñ R I.336), but because the metre he
wanted to refer to is raloddata, and he needed a four syllabic word, he had no
781

choice but to take it. Ifit is true that he had in mind the word rudulin (sorrow)
then it is more appropriate in connection with the word yaḍyṣpin (though), and
the translation would be though in times ṇf sorrow.

XX1I.93. There is a mistake in the numbering of stanzas in Ks text,
namely from no. 92 directly to 98. Stanza no. 98 should be stanza no. 93 and
so on. J has noticed this, but wonders whether there are some stanzas missing.
This is one of the reasons why I doubt ifJ had a ms of the RK when he trans-
lated the kakawin, as he once claimed in some of his notes.

XXI.98b aguti The dictionary (MW p. 4) gives as meaning without
resource, helpless. Hence my translation into could not go anywhkere dse. J seems to
have in mind the N,J. meaning of gati (mind) and renders agali with radelos (at
one’s wits end).

XX1I.103c 1ṛṇwk froth (of water). J. renders it with stroom (current),
perhaps also 9f wuter, but perhaps he has in mind a current of electricity,
because the word stroom is followed by en een bliksem fits (and a flash of light-
ning.

XXI.106d bali kari wĕnaṅa. The number of the stanza in K and J is
111. J expresses his uncertainty on his translation which reads duck hoe ṣou kj
overwinnen è (but how would he win?). In my view, J is inuenced by the word
mênaṅ (to win), while wĕnaṅ, though still very closely related to mĕnaṅ, can mean
to be able lo, capable yf, have the power to.

XXI.112d s9jartatah yat uliha laku ta. The number of the stanza in K
and J is 117. Here is another literal rendering which misses the correct
meaning, as stated by Poerbatjaraka. J renders sṇjartatah with al uw weorden (all
your words), whilst in fact sṇjarta is just another form of sgjāa hkgj, s9jar mpu
and the like, which usually means at your service my lord, all that you wish, well
etc.

XXI.114d paṅliṅganta hati mami malilaṅ. I render it with as a token ṇf
our sincerily to you, based on MW p.901 in which liṅga is explained as token, ṣymbol.
I find this meaning more suitable than J's rendering which reads uw bedld is helder
in ons hart (your image is clear in our heart).

XXI.115d tādé māYha ṅ pinakahulun usên. I render it with let us be slain
in a moment. J seems to misunderstand the word yapwun in line c, because he
renders it with al (although), whilst its correct meaning is if (knwewer). This mis-
782

understanding leads him to assume that māṭṇa means to kill (dooden) rather than
to die (steruen). He should also consider the following stanza, which begins in
his translation as follows als wjj allen vernietigd ṛullen Zṭin (when all of us have
been killed).

XXI.120b ciknān nyāmbśk mami juga mapagph. I.render ambĕk mami
mapagêk with our frm decision, our firm resolwe, whilst J. translates it into mijn gemoed
is gerust (my mind is at easc).

XXT.122d swrat. J renders the word surat with tuekening (picture), but
remarks that he does not understand the phrase kadi ta surat clearly. He says
sura can mean manuscriht, image, picture etc. īIn fact the phrase is freḍuently
found in Oldjavanese stories in various forms, e.g. kadi tap¥l, kadi tugu etc. I
render this word with image in the sense of statue, which implies that the
monkeys do not utter a sound or move a muscle either.

XXI.126-147. This kind of reminder can also be seen on other occasions
of Wiṣṇu’s incarnation, e.g. when he incarnated as Krĕṣṇa and plunged into
the Jamuna river where he then was coiled around by the Kālīya, Balarāma
spoke to him as follows: *‘Divine Lord of the Gods, why do you exhibit this
human frailty Are you not aware of your divine essence? You are the navel
of the universe, the support of the gods, the creator, destroyer, and guardian of
the worlds. The universe is your body. These who have been your relatives
since your descent to man, the cowherds and their wives, are overwhelmed with
despair. Have mercy on them! You have played the babe and the boy; you
have enacted the human weakness. Display now your inñnite power; arise and
conguer the might iend.” Read with this guotation as background, the RK
passages will appear much clearer. See: (1) H. Zimmer, Myths & śymbols
in Indian Art & Cpviliṛation, p. 84-5, (20 M.E. Noble and A.K. Coomaraswamwy,
Mytks ṭf the Hindus & Buddhists, p. 226-8; (3) P. Thomas, Hindu Ruligion,
Customs and Manners, picture 42 opp. p. 19.

XXI.128. The whole stanza is very difñcult to understand, without know-
ledge of similar events in other stories, as mentioned in the preceding note. The
keyword here is prabku in the sense of the Lord, the Master, the most powerful,
the Omnipotent. 1It is almost similar in form with the hymns of the Upanisad.
Hence my translation. I cannot comment on J's translation.

XXI.132c makara riṅ[ṅ] iwak yan adêmit. Here we find a statement
that the makara is a small ksh (ṅwak adkmḍ). It is in fact the prawn, See my
article, Makaru, in the Relung Pustaku,......
783

XXI.134a maṅadśg. I do not know what J has in mind when he renders
the word maṅad¥g with keersers (rulers), whilst obviously what is meant in the
phrase is monsoons. I must admit that the word maṅadśg can mean keerser (ruler,
king), but it is unthinkable to regard a monsoon as a king. The translation of

J. and mine in the following stanzas differ uite a bit and are difñcult to
analyse.

XXI.140c Prahlād.. The daitya Prahlāda is the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu.
Prahlāda was an ardent devotee of Wiṣṇu, and very much hated by his own
father Hīraṇyakaśipu. Hīraṇyakaśipu once was told to kick Prahlāda in the
face, as Rāwaṇa did to Wibhīṣaṇa. In fact Rāwaṇa is the incarnation of
Hiraṇyakaśipu. As Hiraṇyakaśipu can only be slain by Wiṣṇu likewise also
Rāwaṇa. See Monro, Stries of Indian Gods & Heroes, p. 108-19.

XXI.141a waṣaṭ swākā kitātah pau;èṅ. J renders the word pawṅh with
geschenken (gifts), apparently without considering the meaning of the words wuṣa
and swāhā. Waṣaṭ is an exclamation uttered by a holr priest at theend of the
ṣacrifcial verse (MW, p. 930). Swāku is an exclamation used when performing
oblations (MW, p. 1284). So pawèṅ should be understood here as oblations,
offering etc.

c. cala. ]J is not certain with his rendering which is bedriṣgeljjke spelen
(false games). Once and again it is mentioned in the RK that Fortune is very
unstable (śī ya buwat caācala X.34bc) so gambling (ḍāūta) is called tke game of
fortune. Hence my translation.

XXI.142. Concerning Krĕṣṇa slaying the demon Kaṅsa, see Hariwaṅśa.
Concerning Arjuna killing Duryyodhana, the Bhāratayuddha relates that it was
Bhīma who did it.

XX1I.152d indrgjāla. My translation of the word indrgjalu into illusion
is based on MW, p. 166. ]J renders it with list (trick).

XXI.168c lumbu wwk. I render it with water rhubarb, a type of rhubarb
which grows on the banks of rivers, ditches etc. J regards it as a dwandwa
compound.

XXI.177. The movement of Hanūmān reminds me of the movements of
a kehyar-dancer or baris-dancer in Bali. Seeeg. (l) M. Covarrubias, Island
of Bali, p. 232-5, and p. 230-2, (2) J. Coast, Darcers ṭf Bali illustration of
784

Sampih dancing the Kebyar dance; (3) B de Zoete, Dance and Dramu in Buli,
p. 23241.

XXI.179d. In prose this line would read sira makyun umahā mahém ydśa riṅ
praṅ (he badly wants to build up fame in battle). J renders makśm with
beraadslagen (to negotiate), and the unfortunate result can be seen in his trans-
lation which reads maakte kj ṣich gereed om terug te trekken (he prepared to with-
draw) which, if my understanding of Js translation is correct, is not true.
Hanūmān stepped back only to evade the club of Dhūmrākṣa. who, failing to
hit him, would be pushed forward by his own power and would lose his balance.
At this critical moment Hanūmān attacked by hitting Dhūmrākṣa with the stone
in his right hand.

XX1I.192c r-aṅw ṅ ākampāna (he approached ākampāna). Ther in
r-aṅsi stands for Hanūmān and J seems to overlook it with the result that in his
translation, ākampāna becomes the subject instead of the object.

XXI.193a binuru-buru. My reading is not supported by any mss.,
but purely based on the understanding that binuru-ruru means hunted by a deer,
followed by another word also meaning ?deer’, which does not sound very fitting.
Also binuru-buru will be more suitable because it gives a more lively impression of
the actions.

XX1I.201c kiriwili G  R I.433 explains the word kruwi as kluin
stukje, brokje (small things). I am of the opinion that this rendering of kruwil fits
perfectly in the context mus kiriwili (small things made of gold, which can mean
fnery.) (See the Concise Oxford Dictionary p. 445). calanāswaṅgāsamu-samu is
derived from calana-} a-swaṅga-a-sama-sama, meaning calana (moving)4-a-swaṅga
(no part of the body)-*a-sama-sama (uneualled). This rendering also fits with
the word kiriwili in the context. The notion which connects the word caluna
with the Javanese word cdlana (trousers) is not in accordance with the context of
line c. which only mentions various kinds of kuṇḍala maṇik which are types of
jewellery.

XX1I.206b aparan yogya ṇwu kari Lin. The literal translation would be
what else is better to do. Hence my translation. J is not sure of his translation
which reads omdut ket gepaste ervan elders achterblegf (?). He has misunderstood the
words aparan (what) which he renders with omdut (because) and kari (an excla-
mation) which he renders with achkterblef (rest).
785

XXī.207c mwaṅ śyīha nyarddhacandrurddha kawśu ri tkṅah saṅké paṅaliṅa
([and ordered his warriors to advance] in a battle-array called ārddhacandra,
with the main force in the centre with thrusting flanks.) Js rendering is very
hard to follow, reading īiine helpers traden vooruit en hunne slagorde, de Halwe Maan
werd gehaald uit het midden, van de āijden. ī do not have the courage to translate
it,

XX1I.211cd yatra ṅure...... taṅgul taṅ rākṣasa ec. J seems not to see the
relationship between the two phrases and instead of the monkeys parrying off the
weapons of the demons, they fell prey to the blows of the demons, though in
stanza 210, it was stated that the demons were armed with swords, discs etc.
whilst the monkeys were fighting with their bare hands, teeth, nails etc.

XXJ.212. Here J begins with one rākṣasa ghting with a knife and ends
up with two (beiden = both) rākṣasus being killed with their own knives. Also
his understanding of line b raises some doubts.

īXī.216a waṅké niṅ wré tatan lwirlmalara mulat. ete. J's reading is at
fault here, because he appears to stop after malara instead of before, so that he
translates tatan lwir malara into alsṭf geen pijn woelen (as if [the corpses of the
monkeys] felt no pain). How can dead bodies feel pain, one may askè

XXI.217c ṣéko patih pati patih umatikanaṅ rgut. Here the manner of
reading is also crucial. J seems to read as follows yéko patih/pati patihjumatkanaṅ
yā, which he renders with kj is de patih, het ho>fé der patik's, die de aarde doodt (he
is the patih, the chief of the patiks, who kills the world). J should read the text
as follows: ṇéko patih pati/patih umaṅkanaṅ rūk (kill this prime minister, as he is
killing the world). It should be remembered that Prahasta is known to the
monkeys as the prime minister, and the reason that Sugrīwa orders Ndīla to kill
him is because at that very moment Prahasta is sowing death and destruction
amongst the monkey-host, as stated in the foregoing stanzas (213-216).

īXṛ.222c sambartakopama niraṅ kapi Nīla mégha. It seems that J does not
comprehend this line completely, as he could not place the word méghs and left
it unrendered in his translation which reads als de ondergarg der wereld was de aap
Nuamégha (the ape Nīlamêgha was like the destruction of the world). The
prose-order of this line is as follows sambartakaméghopama niran kapi Mla (the ape
N1la was like the clouds/thunder at Doomsday).
786

XXI.225cd tukābkicāri ri siya bahumantra siddhi, aṅhiṅ ṭtuṅ maṅabkicāra
paraṇ tan bn. I render it with “it was Jike spells applied to an expert of all
kinds of formulas, the only person affected by the spells was the person
employing them’. This is a comparison with those arrows which rebound anḍ
fall back on Prahasta¹s chest. J renders it with ke waṣ alsof ājj hem bedekken, di,
wele toover-formulieren kende en toowermucky had. Aleen hem te betwoweren wgg hun doel,
niet anders (it was as if they covered him, who had known many magic formulas
and had magical powers. Only to put spells on him was their intention,
nothing else). It is obvious that there is ṇo trace of the comparison mentioṇeḍ

abowve. rl

XX1I.226a *kuli-śḍin. It seems that J renders it with either uermuweid or
uitg¢put (exhausted) which are synonymous. G  R I.48l renders kyj with éṅgal
(uick). Hence my translation into so,ṇ.

c. alts. J remarks that as means col” and does not ft in the context,
so he translates it into langṛuam (slow). On the other hand J render it with ṇys
kot, in the sense of not dangerous, as ko can also mean vigorous, strong etc, (See
Concise Oxford Dictionary p. 577).

XXII7c uwṣu. J renders it with āacht gekweel (sofṅ warbling of birds).
In Surakarta and Yogyakarta there is a kind of gamelan (music orchestra) which
is called gamelan won->on, consisting of usuaj Javanese musicṇ] instruments, but
not as complete as in a kLneṅan ud; luhuṅ which jṣ usually held at great feastṣ iṇ
the courts. The wwn-won is the type of Javanese chamber-musjc which
is enjoyed quietly, in contrast with the klśr}ṅan played at wedding feasts eṭc,

XXI1.23c tulii The word tuli here rendered as tui-fsh is also , suggestion
of deafness as tuli means also deaf in B].

XXII26. My translation differs very much from that of J, but very hard
to explain.

XXI1.33c ṅasikta (your compassion). I render kg;sihta with Jyour com-
passion, as Kumbhakarṇṇa still talks by comparison. J on the other hand
renders it with uwe geliṭfue (your sweetheart).

XXīI.35a sbwha nya tinātanṭg s4gk (you give in to all thejr wishes). J
renders it with al ww wenschen worden wwor , gewolgd (you give in to al] your wishes),
disregarding ṇu as the third pers. sing/pl., genitive.
787

b. taṇḍa. J renders it with vaandels (banners), perhaps as a result of
failing to see in ṇya (line a) as referring to Rāwaṇa's ofñcers. I translate it into
altendants.

c. ulpāta pati praṅ-praṅ ya. The literal translation should be tṅṣ are the
portents for fighting and killing. J renders it with yoorteekens bestrijdt gij yoortdurend
(you always fght the portents).

XXII41. J overlooks the imperative mood in phrases like ko pĕt kot hgyu
which becomes the main cause of the differences in the translations. See also
my translation of this stanza in my paper: ‘The Oldjavanese Rā;māmyaṇa, its
composer and composition’, read at the International Rāmāyaṇa Seminar in
New Delhi, December 1975.

XX1I.42d ṅ waṅ wuk turu turuṅ wuṅwakĕn. All the mss. 1I use read
waṅbwakśn which does not make sense. J renders line d with inderduad ījt gi
śwmand, die di¢p slaapt en geeuwt (indeed you are someone who is in deep sleep and
yawnṣ). I am indeed struck with amazement by the translation of J which
sounds so incredible. How is it possible that a person in deep sleep could yawr.
Usually one yawns because he is sleepy. If]J really means what he writes here,
nothing can be more insulting to the intelligence of the Javanese writer. On
the other hand, the phrase turuṅ wuṅwakśn or turuṅ wuṅu licerary means not yet
fully awake. In NJ. we have an expression, that is ṅlindur (to talk in the sleep).
It also applies to someone who has expressed a strange thought or opinion, so
that other people regard his view as a dream. In fact Rāwaṇa accuses
Kumbhakarṇṇa of daydreaming or talking in his sleep.

XXIr.43d Kuli. My reading is based on mss. BCDE , and also supported
by the metre. At this point it should be laghu not guru, as iṣ the case when it is
spelt ending with anṅ. This difference in spelling is the reason why J renders
kalih with en (and).

XXīI.53a tar gêlis ṅwaṅ warh. J reads ṅ waṅ and renders the phrase
with niet snel een ander mensch (not uick another person), whilst I read tar gḍis
ṅwaṅ (I am not easy to defeat) waré...... etc.

nyāṅ awak carwa/pañcopacārm ika wruhta riṅ citra pañācgyuda (your body [is the
pot] in which to prepare the offerings, and the five oblations are your know-
ledge of the ṅve ways of ghting). J rendersit with [en als het ofer van] het
lichaam, dut de vijf benoodigheden by het ofer mogen strekken, dat is onze kennis van de
788

heerljjke ujf wapens ([and as the offering] of the body, that might be used as the
five types of necessities in the sacrifce, is our knowledge of the outstanding five
weapons). Poerbatjaraka in T7BG. 72.171, translates the phrase as follows: ons
Lichaam als oferande en onze kennis [in het hanteeren] uan de wijf soorten (?) wapens als
[die, welke noodig is voor het hanteeren van] de vjif benoodigdheden [ś ke ofrr]. (our
body as the offerings-dish and our knowledge [in handling] of the fve types of
weapons as [those needed in the handling of] the fve necessities).

lilaṅ niṭya etc. My translation and those of J and P differ widely and are
very diffcult to analyse, e.g. P renders Mahāwīrabhadréśwara with 4r grole
Wwabhadra, disregarding the word śwaru in the translation, while J sees in the
word raṇāṅgāṅganā the word aṅganā which he renders with wrouwen (women) and
which I find to be absurd. My translation on the other hand might not be
perfect either. In my view mahāwwrabkudreśwara is a combination of M ahêśwara
and Wrrabhadra, both forms of Śiwa. Wirabhadra is a warlike form of Śiwa,
so that it is very correct of Aṅgada to mention him as the godhead to be
worshipped in the battleground. (See a picture of W1rrabhadra in P. Thomas,
Hindu Religion, Customs and Mannurs, opp. p. 27). On the other hand, Śiwa as
Bhadréśwara seems alsoto be known as early as 400 A.D. in Campā, as a
Bhadréśwaraliṅgam was established at the sacred city of Mi-son by king
Bhadrawarman I. Also a Bhadréśwarapati-lingam is known to have been
desecrated by (Sumatran) Malays in the south in the eighth century. This fact is
important because it is so close to the date of the RK itself, (See A.K.
Coomaraswamy, Histoṛy ṇf Indian and Indonesian Arl, Leipzig-New York, 1927, p.
196-7).

XXII.55b śastra hitu. The literal translation of the compound word
is scientifc logic/reasoning. MW. on p. 1304 gives for kéuśāstra (reliance on the
science of dialecticsl. Hence my rendering with excillent instruction. J on the
other hand, añer a remark on the spelling, renders it with heilige geschrifien (holy
scriptures).

XXII.64c alapanta (god of Death, Śaṅkara). The literal translation is
the collector of the end 9f life. ]J refers to it as Kāla, based on KBW.

XX1I1.78a wêt ṇyān durbbalu buribin...... J renders it with omdut kij ṛwak
werd, raakte hj in verwarrirg ...... (because he was weak, he became confused)
which is completely in contradiction with the following line which reads
rustig wierp hij een scherpe lans (calmly he threw a lance). How can a person who
is weak and confused calm)y throw a lance to his opponent ?
789

XXII.79a huntu. J renders as zijne tanden (his teeth) and his translation
becomes preposterous. In my view kuntu which is synonymous with wgja derived
from wgjru (steel) does not refer to the teeth of Kumbhakarṇṇa, but most likely
to the point of his lance which is made of steel.

XXIīII.3d inigit-igit. Apparently J confuses the word igit (to threaten)
with gigit (to bite). As a result his translation which reads terwjḍl hj telkens
gebeten werd (while he was repeatedly bitten) becomes illogical. How can Rāma
discharge an arrow at Kumbhakarṇṇa, if Kumbhakarṇṇa is at such aclose range
that he (Kumbhakarṇṇa) can bite Rāma repeatedly?

XXIII.llc Mantaka - Samaramulta. In this stanza J does not see
Samaramatta as one of the amaṅs (guardians) of the sons of Rāwaṇa, though he
understands Mattaka to be plural. He renders samaramatta with uitgelaten in de
strjjd (noisy in battle). In stanza 16, J introduces Samaramatta as one of the
amaṅs, for the simple reason that he cannot do otherwise, because in this stanza
it is stated that Matta is killed by Saraba and Samaramatta by Nīla. Yet he
does not revise his translacion of stanza 11. Perhaps he is deluded by the pre-
position riṅ, which might be derived from ri-ṅ another form of ri saṅ, used for
persons lower in rank. Another possibility is that ri which in B.I. becomes 4i in
N}J. turns into si, as 4 and s are known to be interchangeable, e.g. ra-kyaṅ—da(ṅ)
śyaṅ—saṅ hyaṅ.

XXIIīn.5. From Js translation it is hard to ind out who is hitting who,
e.g. Pawanaés āoon was in uverlegenheid, omdat hkij getrokken en gekweld werd door hem
(Pawana’s son was in trouble, because he was dragged and tortured by him).
The text reads baribin ta saṅ Pawanaputra &é rya dinudut dimna nira yu...... (Pawana¹s
son was perturbed [treated like that] by him (ṇya—the demon): he (nira—
Pawana’s son) pulled at him (pa—the demon) and insulted him....... It is
apparent that the fault lies in J's disregard concerning the distinctive meaning of
ṇw, ya and nira.

XXIII.17b kuda shwu yékana humi[r] ratha nya kadi parwwatādbhuta magpṅ.
J renders it with duiṛend paarden trokken ṛṭn wagen, als bergen, oo wonderbuarlijk
groot (one thousand horses pulled his wagon, like mountains, so fabulously big).
From the translation one can only deduce that the horses are extremely big like
mountains, whilst the Oldjavanese text suggests that the wagon is so large like
a mountain, so that it needs one thousand horses to pull it.
790

XXIII.21a wekasaṅkwa téki bapu (at length this is my turn, father). J
renders it with laat mijn einde īijn, vader (let it be my end, father).

b. huwusśn. The word hkuwuskn in line b is not rendered in J's translation,
but the one in line c is rendered by nadut (afterwards). In fact huwusên is the
full form of usĕn (soon, in a moment etc.).

XXII1.22b duṛṇyaśa hiṅśaka brata baka (wicked murderers who made the
vow of the heron). This phrase seems to refer to the story of the Pañcatantra
of the heron which eats the fish of a pond, but is knally killed by a crab.

XXII1.23d wimohandśarāstra (an arrow that causes perplexity to the
enemy). It seems that in Oldjavanese and in Jawvanese it is called gji sirśp
(see note about gji sirśh). In M.L. Sen, Tṅe Ramyyan, I11.313 it is called the
tamasi-mgya, which can produce darkness to confuse the enemy. As wimohanaśara,
adr¥ṣu tanla etc., in my opinion, belong to the feld of black-magic, it might
have its source in the Atharwawéda or other sources dealing with such matters.
The Atharwawéda, in Sacred Books of the Eust, vol. XLII, does not directly
mention exactly the name wimokanaśora, but contains some battle charws to con-
fuse the enemy. See Chapter V. The wimohanaśara is also mentioned in the
Wirāṭaparwa, used by Arjuna to put the Kaurawas out of action. (See P. Zoet-
mulder, Sekar Sumawwr, I1.70).

XXIII.24c adrśṛṇa tantra. This spell was also obtained by Indrajit
when he made sacrifices in the Nikumbhila grove. Besides making himself in-
visible, he also has an invincible bow, inexhaustible guivers and formidable
weapons which he uses, in the following stanzas, to defeat the monkey host. See
M.L. Sen, Tke Ramwyan, I11.313, and HPS. III.460-1.

XXIII.26b gji sirĕp. This spell called gji sirĕp in Oldjavanese, seems
to be the wimohana-śara in the RK or the tamushi-mgya in the Skt. Rāmāyaṇa
(See M.L. Sen, ITI.313). In Java, people still believe that burglars make use of
this kind of spell to put to sleep the owners of the house he wants to break in.
There is mention of all kinds of spells and formulas in the Serat Cenṭini too.
Usually the gṛisirśp is called A4ji Sirśp Béganunda, a corruptive form of
Méghanāda (Indrajit). See further: (1) J. Knebel, Amulettes Javanaises,
7BG X1(1899). (20 Tawney, ‘The Hand of Glory, Kauthūsaritsāgaru, II1.
ṭ51. (3) S.P. Paku Buwono V, Śerat Cenṭini.
791

XXIīI.27c tamar kélu masampar an sapu mata. J renders masampur with
met ower de borst gekruiste armen [jjne ogen wrijvende] ([rubbing his eyes] with his
arms crossed over his chest). I prefer to render masampar with sitting crossed
legged, as sampar in N.J. always has connotation with the legs. I have the
feeling that Wibhrṣaṇa must be sitting in a yoga-āsanu, such as the padmāsana,
and the like, while uttering the formula śṭpasañjuta, to keep himself alert. It is
also more convenient to rub ones eyes with one’s hands while sitting than
while one’s hands are crossed over one’s chest.

XXII1.28a gji dyusaājata (weapon of light). If gji sirśp is known in
Javanese literature, so far I have not come across gji śpasaājata which seems to
be a magic formula to counter the gji sirś. 1If that is correct then we might
find a clue here to trace back its source, namely the white magic or even in the
Atharwawéda too. I also render diusaājata with formula ṭf alertness, as it keeps
one awake/alert and free from drowsiness or sleepiness caused by the
wimohandśara.

XXIī1.32a Himagiri Himagiri (the peak of snow) is one of the peaks
of the Himalayas. In Java, Himagiri (pronounced Imagiri) is the name of a
hill where the princes of Surakarta and Jogyakarta (named after Ayodhyā) are
buried. In the RK. there are 4 herbs mentioned, these are mohkoṣudhiluta or
paramahoṣadhi, wiśalyakariw, mrĕtagjuwant and braṇitasandhimṭ, whilst in the Skt.
Rāmāyaṇa the fourth name is suwarṇakaraṇi. J marvels that this part of the
story, Hanūmāns search for these herbs, is not found in the Bhatṭṭikāvyaés trans-
lation of Leonardi (see e.g. p. 164-169).

XXII1.33d narāṇya. J renders it with den worst (the king) which
obviously refers to Rāma. As in the RK the person who reuests Hanūmā;n
to look for the medical herbs is Wibhī”waṇa— in the Skt. Rām, it is Jāmbawān—
in neither case it is Rāma, I am of the opinion that narāṇu refers to
Wibhīṣaṇa.

XXII1.35a pinalyan aturu. J renders it with gedood waren en geslapen
hadden (were killed and had been sleeping). On the other hand I regard
pinaṇan aturu as being synonymous with pinalwun an atyru (killed while asleep).
Hence my translation.

XXTI1.36d saguṇṅ raṇāṅgana (as mighty [as his father] in combat). J
renders it with in alle listen in den strjjd (in all strategy of combat). My trans-
792

lation is based on the assumption, that the comparison of sons with father
goes further than merely a physical comparison but also as in the expression
like father like son. (See R. Goris, Storm-kind en Geestes Zoon, Djawa, 1927).

XXIIT4lc karatala. J seems to confuse karatalu (hand) with krétula
(knife), and forgets that the monkeys do not fight with daggers, knives, swords
and so on.

XXII.54c makanu riṅ raṇa. J seems to think that makana is derived
from makan (to eat), so that he renders the above phrase with om t eten op kel
slagveld (to eat on the battlefeld). Perhaps he is influenced by the exploits of
Kumbhakarṇṇa who devoured the monkeys on the battleeld. But in the
whole story, with the exception of Kumbhakarṇṇa, there is no evidence that
the demons had eaten the monkeys. 1In fact makana is derived from kun (to be
satisñed or pleased, to strive after). Hence my translation into to be succesṣful in
batlle. See MW p. 248.

XXIīI.56a apan tahu turuṅ inamśs (they were experienced soldiers and
were never defeated).  J translates the phrase into want ṭ waren bedrewen, dwch
āṭj werden in de pan gehakt (because they were skilful, yet they were wiped out). J
misunderstands the word turuṅ (never yet).

XXIīī.57c ginulumi. J remarks that gulum is a kind of weapon. I do
not think so. The demons are said to be armed with shields and lances. I
assume that gulum here is the strategy of ghting which is mentioned in stanza
55, and which I imagine to be carried out as follows: there are soldiers
attacking the monkeys with missiles, to prevent them from advancing, the
shields are used to protect the missile throwers and the lancers from the missiles
thrown back at them by the monkeys, then slowly the demons close in (gulum)
on the monkeys.

XXIII.ś8d ta pgag arawgyan. J’s frst reading of the phrase is ta paya
garawgyan, then he remarks that it should be read as tapgy agarawgyan, because
he thinks that the demons become like tspṇ (a dish, J says) which spreads
everywhere. 1I will concede that arawgyan means to spread everywhere, but not
agarawgyan. Thus I read the phrase t pgyag arawṇwan, assuming the word payag
is derived from ygg (to shake), which in N,J. develops into ṇwag (shaky). I render
the phrase above as shaky and broken.
793

XXI11.62d ya tamatan patahśn apulihan. J renders it with kon ket niet
standhouden en keerde terug (it could not hold its position and retreated). I render
it in a different way, in fact almost the opposite, as follows: and because there
was no wood, ils attack could not be repelled, in the assumption that the fire, because
there is no wood, then attacks the monkey soldiers.

XXIī1.65b daṅu-daṅu bali kari balawān. J remarks that balikari is not
found in the Oldjavanese dictionaries. The word kari is an exclamation word.
This is the main cause of J's difñculty, because he reads it incorrectly, but his
guessing of the translation is close enough.

XXIII.69d saṅ atakśn (the woodcutter). 2 J renders it with de eigenaar
wan den boom (the owner of the tree). I wonder who. I render the woodcutter
as Rāma, but I cannot say that Rāma is the owner of the tree-trunk
(Rāwaṇa).

XXIII.7lc waruga. It might be that the correct reading is waraga
(name of a place) probably in the temple compound (See MW p. 922). ]Js
reading is waruṇa, rendered by J with gebouw (building) and it seems that J reads
it waruga also (see Js w.l, p. 519).

d. iri pañarita nira. Based on M.W. p. 389, I render the phrase above
with in kis undertaking which differs very much from J's rendering which reads
het beloop van īijn verhual (the course of his story).

XXII1.77a tĕka ta umaṇḍĕm aṅrśpa maṅaṅ ya maṅhkrik aṅakar (they came, and
took position. Some were suatting, some lying on their stomachs, opening
their mouths and roaring, expressing their eagerness to attack). J's rendering
reads as follows zij kwamen voorovervallende, met open mond, klagende and krjjsende (they
came falling headlong forward, with open mouths, they moaned and screamed).
Taking it word by word the rendering cannot be said incorrect, but the image
created is definitely different.

XXIII.78d sakatĕmu dé nya dṅna dinudut tśwêknya kawatêk. I render this
Jine with once they met, [one 9f them] will be slain or ber¢ft ṭf his dugger. J translates
it in a different way as ieder, die ījṭj tegenkwamen, wus beklagenswaardig. ij trokken
hun dolk en trokken die uit (everyone, whom they met was doomed, they drew their
daggers and drew them out).

XXIII8lc akara-karā (maimed). J renders the word akura-karā with
straalden (shining), perhaps thinking that it is synonymous with makarakata. How-
794

ever, straalden is not in my opinion the suitable rendering. My translation is
based on M.W.p. l.

XXIII.84c makyāmāk ika saṅ Mahodara (yelling loudly Mahodara advanced
...... etc). J renders it with Makodurṇ Jjuichte en trad woedend (Mahodara was
elated and stepped forward furiously......etc.).

XXIV.3d agnṭṇāūsia panah apw pwa pamal¥s saṅ Rāmu ls lina ya. I render
this line with tkṣ were nullified śy Rāmus arrow 9f fre which made them (the arrows of
Rāwaya) disappear. So it is apparent here that I render Ja with them referring to
Rāwaṇajs arrows. On the other hand J's rendering is as follows: de Zgnṣustra
9f vuwpijl, het gfiweerwapen van Rama, verdween en ging weg (the āgnéyāstra or arrow
of fire, the weapon of Rāma for defence, disappeared and went away). So
according to J the arrow which disappears is Rāma’s.

XXIV.8ĕc héman [n}ikuṅ Lakṣmaya (look añer Lakṣmaṇa). J renders it
with ket is jammer van deāen Lakṣmays (it is a pity for this Lakṣmaṇa).

XXIV.10 pskhkaṅ kani. The word ppki, derived from göṅ, in B.I. pĕrahk-
i, means to sprinkle a liṇuid obtained by sgueeṣing something on something. Hence my
translation of the phrase with /and applied the cure ] ś sprinkling the water 9f the
braṇitasandhim ] until the wound wus healed, J's rendering, hkj perste de wond ui (he
sgueezed the wound out), is misleading.

XXIV.1la māraṇa hilaṅ (the wounded is cured). J's rendering reads
de duod is verdwenen (the death disappears) is ambiguous.

XXIV.13. My translation of this stanza is also found in my paper titled
*The Oldjavanese Rāmāyaṇa, its composer and composition’, presented at the
International Rāmāyaṇa Seminar in December 1975 in New Delhi. Also stanza
134, 135 and 216.

XXIV.l4c mulul ta sira saṅ Daśānana sawismgyāmgya-mṇījṇā nrśpasuta
(Daśānana saw this with dismay, and it dawned on him that the prince would
be victorious). J's rendering is 4it ṛiende was Daśānana werbaasd, dit houdend, yoor
eene āiens begoocheling, dat de koningsṛoon ṭou owerwinnen (Seeing this, Daśānana waṣ
surprised, and regarded it as a delusion, that the prince would be victoriouy).
The keyword for the difference is the word amgya-maya which ]J renders with
eene iensbegoocheling (a delusion), whilst I see jt us something that becomes
increasingly clearer to someone, referring here to Rāwaṇaīs disbelief that Rāma
795

could win to the state that there is a possibility now, when Rāma receives a
chariot from god Indra, which gives Rāma eual chance of winning.

XXīV.20a kya. J cannot fnd the meaning of this word in the Javanese
and Oldjavanese dictionaries. I knd it in the M.W. p. 318 with a cross-reference
to p. 240. Hence my translation into comet. This rendering proves to be in
accordance with the second metaphor.

XX1V.24. ]J remarks that perhaps the stanza is not original, because of
the numerous repetition of words, and J thinks he translates this stanza half-
heartedly, which is just a rendering of one word by anmother. This is also true
for stanzas 25, 26 and 27.

XXIV.27b śiwnmukha. J regards it as a proper name. I think it fts
better in the context if it is rendered as arrow. See M.W. p. 1073. Zoetmulder
in his book Sekar-Sumawur I1.67 spells it śilumukha, but on p. 68 Śilīmukha (with
a capital Ś).

XX1IV.29a haṅin umirir (the wind blew softly). J renders it with de
wind blies daverend (the wind blew thunderously) which is -anachronistic with the
yest of the sentence which reads en de uarde was bedaard (and the earth was calm).
The word umirir is perhaps the older form of sumilir in NJ. The word sumilir is
contained in a Javanese tune called ilir-ilir, all these words seem to refer to the
gentle blowing [of the] wind- A tune from Celebes has the same theme. It is
called aṅin mamiri.

XXIV.34-37. The translation of these stanzas is very diñcult to com-
pare.

ñXXIV.32. Perhaps this stanza contains the explanation of the picture of
the phallus and vulva at the threshold of the door of the temple of Sukuh, and
the legend of the test of the bride, because it symbolizes the mystical union of
the divine, in other words the union between Śiwa and his Śakti. For further
reading about Śiwa and Śakti see H. Zimmer, Mptks and Śymbols in Indian Art
and Civilization, p. 137-48. A. Avalon: 1. 7ṅâe Serpent-Power, esp. p. 181-256.
9. Principles ṇf Tantra, esp. chapter IX, Shiva and Shakti F. Leeson: Kamu
śhilpa, 2nd ed., chapter III.

XX1IV.38d tuban. 1ī regard the word tubun as derived from tuba
(poisonj. See G & R, I, p. 716-7. '=l'he phrase kat bśbisa in BI. fits also
796

in the context. J, rendering it with waterwal (waterfall), might be infḍuenced
by the meaning of the word humuṅ which he renders with bruischend (roaring).

XXIV4lc ri géṅ ni tan asikta gvṅ galak al6k hiḍé ni ṅhulun. The
difference in translation between J's and mine is explained in the reading of the
text. I read ri göṅ ni tan asihta/gpṅ galak/alék hiḍḍp ni ṅhulun (because of your lack
of love and [your] great anger, my mind was very much perturbed), whilst J
seems to read as follows ri géṅ ni tan asihta/göṅ galak alvk hiḍśp ni ṅhulun (wegens
uwe groote ligfdeloosheid werd mijn toorn groot en werd mṭn gemoed neerslachlig— because
of your lovelessness, I became very angry and my mind became depressed).
The only reason for my reading as such is that there is no mention of anger on
Wibhīṣaṇa>s part, when he was kicked in the face by Rāwaṇa, as related in
XIV61, as follows:

Jali saṅ sujana yar pinaribhawa, nirwikgra sira dhwo tar akumĕl,

tulyu sāgara ikaṅ hati malilaṅ, tar kkniṅ gĕlé-gĕlêh śuci satata.

(the nature of a noble man when he is insulted, is that he remains composed
and unworried. His mind is like the ocean, it is not polluted by ñith and
remains pure forever).

XX1IV.43d apan saphala saṅ Daśāgyār pṭah (because Daśāsya has died with
honour). J renders it with want Daśāṣa verdinde te sterwen (because Daśāsya
deserved to be killed). Perhaps J has in mind Wibhīṣaṇa’s words, which blame
Daśāsya for his own death, but it should be remembered that all those bad things
Daśāsya has done causes only sadness and grief to Wibhṣ”waṇa. I based
Rāghawa’s soothing words to Wibhīṣaṇa to Rāghawaīs further elaborations,
why Daśāsya died with honour, as contained in the following stanzas 44 and 45,
especially these lines: *...... He died in ierce combat. Whoever dies in battle
he goes to heaven. You should not be in grief over him, because he died in
great glory in the battleñeld...... h

XXIV.46c mudhaṇyana manah nikaṅ duṛjjana (make the evil minded demons
aware of [their wrong deeds)). I regard mudhaṇwana as being derived from
umudharyana from um-udhani-an-a. On the other hand J seems to regard it as a
derivative of mudha (dwaasheid—foolishness) which is incorrect.

XXīV.50d : panaṇḍa pada. J reads panaṇfa paḍa and renders it with
als een schat bewaarder (as a treasurer). I prefer the reading as it is and translate
panaṇḍa (something to signify) and padu (steps). I believe my rendering is more
suitable and more likely.
797

XXIīV.51b apan hana bkaṭāra muṅgwiṅ sira. I render bkaṭāra with deities
(plural) whilst J renders it with eene Godheid (a godhead, singular). We must
remember that in the following line it is stated that there are eight deities in the
body of a king or in other words a king is the embodiment of eight deities. So
it must be in plural.

XXIV.53a brata. J renders it with gelṭṅe (vow) whilst I translate it
as meritorious act, with the stress on act or deeds, because we will see in the
following stanzas that it is not merely a vow, but actions are meant. See M.W.
p. 1042.

XXIV.58b taman pun¥péṅ*ṅ paṅan mwaṅ inum.  J renders taman panĕbĕṅa
with gonder op te houden (without restraint). My rendering is just the other way
around, because I understand pśpśṅ or p¥ṅp¥ṅ as to take advantage of the opportuniṭy
while something lust or to opportune in something. Hence my rendering with to owerdo.
The phrase in NJ. for this kind of counsel in ḍja ṅṇji pupuṅ.

XXIV.blcd )u taltana ya tū maṇiktékana ulah masśsśran ya sĕsśran magpṅ.
Without an understanding of the underlying idea of the comparison of the pearl
necklace, a satisfactory and meaningful translation of these lines is unthinkable.
] refer to Js translation which reads hij worde gewolgd als een juweelen halssnoer, dat
schuift als een groote ring (he is followed like a pearl necklace, which moves like a
big ring). It sound senseless, illogical and proves meaningless, e.g. how could a
ṇecklace move like a big ring, how does a ring moveè The absence of a note
how little it might be which may reveal J's understanding of the line, make it
the more obscurc.

Below is an attempt to unravel the meaning of the pearl necklace. The
size of the pearls is not the same, one is bigger than the other and so on till the
smallest of them all, yet they form a complete unit. Another clue is the word
sśṣṣr which means to spin. It is not the necklace that spins, as J's translation
suggests, but the pearls. Hence my translation into like pearls in a necklace. The
necklace is only to denote that the pearls form a unit, related one to the other
in a certain system. The pearls spin. So in my mind the necklace is in fact an
allegory of the solar system, in which the sun is the biggest, followed by its
satellites of lesser size. In our case the sun is the biggest pearl which refers to
the king.

XXIV.62cd gari&. J renders it with verticale streep tusschen de wenkbrouwen
(the vertical line between eyebrows). I am certain J means the tilaka (a mark
798

on the forehead of girls, made with colouṛed earth etc) See M.W. p. 448. I
am convinced with the translation here, because tiluka is also a kind of obser-
vance. The cintāmaṇi is a jewel worn on the forehead. M.W. renders it with
thought gem, supposed to yield to its possessor all desires, which is in accordance
with the attributes of Śiwa as the Supreme Deity. There might be a correlation
between the tilaka, the cintāmaṇi and the trwégṭ, the point where the Suṣumnānāḍr
meets the Iḍā and Piṅgalā nāḍīs, which is assumed to be located in the forehead,
also believed to be the location of the gjāācakra. Sce: (1) A. Avalon, T7ṅe
Śerpent Powar, p. 322, (2) H. Zimmer, Myths & Śṣmbols etc. In Oldjavanese
literature, see Dṅkarmaśaṇw (the Philosophy of the Void).

XXIV.63d wiśṛṭa makuṭa. J renders it with wienṣ onderscheidingsteeken a
kroon is (one whose distinguishing mark is a crown). M.W. p. 990 conñrms this,
hence my translation into king. From stanza 63 down to stanza 86, there are
di/erences in the translation which are hard to defne.

XX1V.64a masimsima samgdki. To me there is only one explanation
of this phrase, namely that samādṅi iṣ the means to obtain union with gud symbo-
lized here by a ring. Therefore samadki is the keyword, meaning abstracl
meditation and union (See M.W. p. 1159).

XXIV.70c pṣah pwa kia dusṣṭa mantun nikā. J renders it with bjś uw dood
blijuven uwe slichte daden achter (when you are dead, your bad deeds stay behind).
Deknitely it is not true. Were it true, then the dogma about karmu is false.
What is wrong with Js translation is that he regards duṣla, which he renderṣ as
bad deeds, as the subject of the sentence, whilst in fact the subject is still withaw,
(power) in line a. See Introduction about the relationship between the RK and
the Nītiśāstra.

XXIV.%4a tat yṇwala. J suggests to read it aṣ talwṇjwala and tranṣlateg
it accordingly as dr glanṛende wuarhuid (the brilliant truth). I do pṇot agree with
him and maintain the reading as it is, and render it śe alwgs open, which meaṇs
that even in sleep the king must always be alert.

XXIV.78d asiṅ malahakśn malgbway malit. J remarks that he cannot
translate the word mala. I render jit wjth opponent, based on M.W. p. 792 which
explains that malu means physical and moral impurities. These kinds of in.-
purities are referred to in the R.K. as the enemies/opponents from within
and without, eg. in the following stanza. See the word mul, (impurities) in
stanza 85.
799

XXJIV.87-126 are translated into English by C. Hooykaas in his article
titled, ‘The Paradise on Earth in Leṅka’, in B.kīl 114(1958). CH is the code
used for C. Hooykaas. I could not suppress the impression that CH closely
follows J. Stanza 100-107 is also translated by W. Aichele in Djawa 8(1929).

XXIV.9lb brata. J and CH render it with gel&ḍe and wow respectively,
whilst I translate it as act (See MW. p. 1042).

XXIV.92d amalés. J renders it with wederom (again), CH with and took
is former shape and  render it with as compensation.

XXīV.93d hiḍṭ ṛwa maturu ṅuni pśah yāṅpi J renders it with en
werbeelden ich, dat gjj vroeger geslapen hadden en gedroomd hadden, dat ij dood waren.
Translated into English we will get CH>s translation which reads thṣy thought that
in their sleep they had dreamed of being killed. My translation reads as follows thṇ
thought that thgy were asleep and dreaming when [actually] thg were dead.

XXīIV.95a sāmpun sampārṇna sampat sira ratu sumilih Lĕṅkādpa gahan. J
renders it with nadat kij volkomen volmaakt was geworden, wolgde hkij op als worst van
Langka vermaard. CH’s rendering which reads gfwr [Wibhṣṛaṇa] kad been made
completely perfect he succeeded as a king in Lśṅkā renowned is an exact translation of
J’s rendering. On the other hand my rendering, reading [Wibhtṛsaṇa] wus
perfectly installed as king and acknowledged throughout the kingdom of Lĕṅkā, based on
ṭhe assumption that the ñrst part of the sentence (the installation of Wibhīṣaṇa
as king) is referring to stanza 89, the second part is the recognition of the people
outside the capital city. The word gakan (vermuurd, renowned) refers to the
fact that the people throughout Lĕṅkā had at least received the news of the
succession.

XXIV.95b saṅ hwuṅ bkata. saṅ Guṇa. kād¥g sira mulat. J renders saṅ
kyan bhata with de Opperwezen (the Supreme Being). CH renders it with gods,
demows. ī regard it as a dwandwa compound, in the same meaning as surāsura or
dbwadaihṇa.

My reading of saṅ is m.c. and Guṇa is based on mss BCDEF. See
Kalangwan, p. 462, no. 9, śardulawiknḍita. K s reading is sagana, rendered by ]J.
with met de Gana's and CH with and demi-gods. In my opinion saṅ Guṇu is the
appropriate reading. Many times Wibhñaṇa is called guṇawān (the virtuous
one) e.g. in stanza 98, a., only 3 stanzas further. In the New-Javanese literature
(e.g. Serat Rama) or by the Javanese people, Wibhīṣaṇa iṣ better known as
Gunawan Wibisana.
800

kad¥g sira mulat. CH is at a loss in translating the last part of this line
which he signifes with a note and guestion mark. J renders it with ṛṭ zagen,
dat hij geinstalleerd jjn (they saw, that he was installed [as king]). The key-word
is kād¥g which CH and J seem to give the same meaning as adśg in madḍg before
it. The Javanese euivalent for kādśg is ājén¥r and in B.ī. it is (berdiri) t4rmangu-
mangu. Hence my translation into to stand agape.

XXIV.97b aṅl. This word is rendered by CH with unwwsiṇ. The
literal meaning is worn oul, tired, exhausted etc., so that manuk aṅU is a tired bird,
hence my rendering into resting.

XXIV.98d matwab. I render matwab (belching) with stomach-acke,
because in this case belching is usually the result of stomach-ache due to over-
eating of durians.

XXIV.99d sonyāṅawṇy-awgy. I render it with beckoning kindh, whilst
CH translates into nodding to each other. In my imagination, the śrigaḍṅ and
mango flowers which are waiting for the bees to come, are beckoning them
because they have stayed too long at the aśwka and other fowers.

XXIV.100b milwāp¥s téka roṇyānipis amgya-mayā āpan maṇimṇo. Aichele
renders this part with a lotus ṭf cṇstal. In the story of How King Vinitamati
became a Holy Man (T%e Oceun ¢f stog, V1.69 sḍq) we find a story concerning a
lotus of crystal in the lake of Mānasa.

XXIV.100d mawa ṅ inak bogêéṅ madhukara. W. Aichele (W.A.) renders
it with woert het de āoete spjs der bjjen met ṇich mede (brought with it the sweet food
aroma (*) along). I render it with arousing the appetite of the bees, based on the
literally translation which in my view should read bringing craving por good food
to the bees.

XX1IV.101a buwmi kanaka. I translate bumi into nest, as in Sundanese
the word bumi means house, which is perfectly suitable in this contextt CH
renders it with the Gold country, perhaps he is thinking suwarṇadwṇu (the island
of gold—Sumatra) or he takes it over from W. Aichele.

XXIV.104d mahandodohi sakarêṅ. The literary translation is intentionally
turning awgy for a whil. CH renders it with momentayy show 9f indiference.

XXIV.105. I cannot describe the differences in translation between CH>s
and mine. Aicheles can be regarded as a variation.

XXIV.106d ḍarapati wḍu wok yékm pipi ruṣu. Darapati is a wood-pigeon
801

or ring-dove. 1I have translated the phrase above in accordance with the des-
cription of a ring-dove found in Webster's Tṅird New International Dictionaṛy, page
1958 column 3, which reads:

1. a common European pigeon (Columba palumbus) larger than the
stock-dove or rock pigeon and having on each side of the neck a whitish patch
and the wing edged with white.

2. a small dove (Streptopelia risoria) of South-eastern Europe and much
of Asia that is related to the common turtle dove, is often kept as a cage bird,
and is buffy with a black collar.

In my opinion the description of Columba palumbus is closer to that in
the RK, although the dictionary mentions it as a common European bird, the
idea concerning the bird might originate from the Ariers. Hence my translation.
The word ruṛa gives the frst clue. M.W. p. 886, renders rās—rĕṣaki with lo
adorn to decorate. CHUs translation of pipiruṣa is based on F.H. van Naerssenés
hypbthesis of the word pipirusa which van Naerrssen himself still doubted.
Because of the nature of his perception of this word, CH puts a guestion mark
after his translation. Aichele renders it with terwjl kj met lokkende toon śuit (while
he emitted cries in teasing tones).

XXIV.107a satwātāt buddhi satwa prasama tan asuwé ta wwaṅ nya mapalpṅ.
Jt seems that the juggling with the word satwu in the phrase satwātāt buddki satwa
has led CH astray. He even considered buddhi satwa as meaning Bodhisattwa.
CH’s reading of the word ta wwaṅ nya which he reads as tawwaṅṇa, plunges him
into confusion and forces him to put a question mark afer his translation.
Aicheleés translation of the second part is also caused by his misunderstanding
of the word ta wwaṅ ṇya. The description of this stanza reminds me of the
description of the hermitage of the sage Kaṇwa, the father of Śakuntalā in the
diparwa.

XXIV.108a moṅ taṅ moṅ. Here also CH misunderstands the phrase
which literally means the tigers are no longer ligers, in the sense that they are not
wild and ferocious. In this stanza it is said that instead of chasing the
deer, the tiger is gored by the deer and instead of roaring with anger, the
tiger is crying out. The camara and kañcil are regarded as being the same genus
by the Javanese author, as is also the case with other animals, e.g. ṣuṅ with atal
etc. If a translator does not realize this fact, he will probably be confused. In
my view the principle underlying this fact is similar 'ṭo the usage of so many
ṇames for one person, e.g. Rāma is also rendered with Rāghawa, Raghusuta,
802

Raghūttama, Rāmabhadra etc, Hanūmān with Pawanasuta, Māruti, Bāyuputra
etc.

XXIV.109sq. Only by closely studying the behaviour of those animals
in their natural habitat can a translator be inspired to make a good translation
of these kinds of descriptions in the Rāmāyaṇa. Reading my translation
and comparing it with CH’s, one may wonder, whether we use different Old-
javanese texts.

XXIV.122a luṅluṅ. I render the word luṅluṅ with skwots of [creeers],
whilst CH regards it as a kind of bird, The translation of the rest of the stanza
is very divergent.

XXIV.123c binturun. J in his wordlist p. 405 renders the word binturun
with a kḍe ṭf bird. Seemingly CH agrees with J, as he renders binturun with
binturun-birds. I prefer to think of binturun as a hhe of monkg, since there are
already various types mentioned in the foregoing lines e.g. tukaṅ, wêruk, woraṅ-
utan and perhaps also kinturun. Also the following phrase which reads yan turuṅ
aturu-turu riṅ toraṇa maṇik saṇḍiṅ laṇḍak (which descended from the tree and took
a nap in the jewelled pavillion near a porcupine) seems to justiṛ my guess. I
must admit that the sight of a bird sleeping near a porcupine might be nice, but
I insist that it is most unlikely.

XXIV.124a tulhyāmśapatha. I analyze tulyāśapathu into tulya-a-śapatha (as
if they never curse one another, as if they never guarrel with each other). I
render the phrase above with us if expressing their fondness of each other. CH(s
translation is inspired by his daughter, who apparently has read the book of
Prof. A.L. Basham, The Wonder that wus India, especially about the ordeal of the
ploughshare. However, as a village boy, I grew up amongst domesticated
animals, like goats, sheep, cows and bufaloes etc., and the above mentioned
phrase only brings back pictures, buried and hidden away in the memories of
childhood long, long ago. The translation of CH and J of the remaining two
lines is almost beyond comprehension.

XXIV.125c mĕné tṅ ṣasa sinawuṅ. J misses the word tāṅ in the trans-
lation or misunderstands it. Instead of a negation, tāṅ as a variant of tan, he
understands it as a particle denoting emphasis. The word tan as such can also
be found in stanza 108a (moṅ taṅ moṅ.. CH’s translation agrees with mine.

XXIV.129. J seems at a loss here. Apparently he has forgotten the
treatment Sitā had experienced in the Aśoka garden, which was witnessed
803

by Hanumān, Hence his incomprehensible translation, which he himself
guestions.

XXIV.134. See my translation of this stanza in my paper titled, *The
Oldjavanese Rāmāyaṇa, its composer and composition_.

XXIV.147c aṭu tat. I render it with because, whilst J renders it with
waarom (why) which gives rise to the controversy in translation. See following
note.

XXIV.148-153. The text of the RK at this part appears to be very
brief in comparison with the Śkt. version, so that many things are left out,
creating misunderstanding on the part of translators of the RK. By comparing
jt with the Skt. version, BK. L, p. 183-5 and HPS. 111.334-7, I consider that I
am in a better position than J in this case.

XXIV.155a hana sira. J seems to read it huné sira and regards sira as
being second pers., sing. or plural, as evident in his translation which reads
di in u ṇṭn (who are in you). It is obvious that his mind still lingers on the
Hastabrata.

XX1I1V.162c dulk. I render it with distress, whilstJ translates it into
haat (hatred) which in my view has no support from the text. There is no
ṭrace of hatred in the heart and mind of Sītā. She prefers to die on the pyre,
because she wants to be reunited with Rāma in heaven. If she hates Rāma,
because of his suspicion of her, most likely she will leave him, and not remain
faithful.

XXīV.174cd alāṅ-alaṅ dnta dhumāraṇa ṅ prajā, apat[ṭ] ala[d] dé nikanaṅ
malānaput. The literal translation is there[will be] many hindrances for you in giving
protection to the world, because you are bud, owerwhelmed ky impurities. J obviously reads
alad instead of alu, the d is only m.c., likewise the second t.

XXIV.176d apan[n] ikaṅ karmma lświk lawan widhi This phrase is
comparable with an expression in N}J. which reads ṭjar kalah déniṅ dasar (nature
jṣ stronger than education). However J renders widhi with Schepper (Creator),
so that his translation reads as follows: want de som van goede and slechte werken is
machtiger dan de Schepper (because the total of good and bad conduct is more
powerful than the Creator) which is completely untrue.

XXIV.178a mapūpa. I render it with miserable, based on MW. p. 618,
while J translates it into sleckt (bad).
804

cd. naréśwerāṅhiṅ sira liṅku ultama, tathgpi yar śoka nihan sirāpasah.  These
lines are very diffcult to understand. J's rendering is bewildering. I am of
the opinion that Trijaṭā is hinting on Rāma’s separation from Sītī. At that
time Rāma, according to Trijaṭā, is the best man on earth. Hence my trans-

lation.
XXIV.182d bhakti. My rendering is based on mss. BEF. Ko s text
reads bkakta and J renders it with elen (to eat).

XXIV.198a rama. J regards the word rāmu as a proper name, Rāma,
whilst I regard it as a derivative of amu (father).

XXIV.200d dampaṅ (husband and wife). The reference to this form
of Wiṣṇu is of course the form of Wiṣṇu as Arddhanari, half Wiṣṇu and half

Śrī.

XXIV.211b apus. In Javanese apus can mean weak, feeble, not well. J
remarks that the meanings of the word apus in the dictionaries do not fñt the

context.

XXIV.214 Yamunū ya wĕnaṅ mauṅh hayu
ta-sibu buddki ya śuddhi dé nika
tśmu taṅ lwah agöṅ sunirmmala
ralu niṅ tṭrtha pawitra Jāhnawr
(The river Yamunā is able to give you happiness. Take a bath there and your
mind will be puriñed. Then you will come to a big flawless river, the king of
holy rivers, the Jāhnawṅ).

The rivers Yamunm and Jāhnawī (Ganges) are indeed regarded as sacred
and I strongly believe that the Oldjavanese poet does not only tell his readers,
that if someone physically takes a bath there, their mind will be purifed,
because he knows that the readers of the RK which is written in Oldjavanese
will not be able to go to India. What the rakawi wants to express is perhaps its
symbol in Tantric mysticism, because the Yamunm; and the Gaṅgā according to
theSammohana Tantra, are supposed to be the Piṅgalā and Iḍā nāḍrs. The Suṣumnā
is supposed to be the Saraswatī river. Sometimes the Gaṅgm and the Saraswati
is reversed. It is said that these three nadis meet at one spot between the eye-
brows, called triweṇ,, where the gjāā-cakra is located. Then it is stated that
bathing there (at the meeting-place of the three rivers =triwéṇ) yields abun-
dant fruit. A. Avalon expounds that by batking there, is meant when the mind
is suffused with a full knowledge of this cakra, great benekt is thereby attained
805

(The Serpent power, p. 322, notes no. 2and 5 and p. 181-256). H. Zimmer states
that the Ganges is said to be sukka-dā (bestowing prosperity) and mokṣa-dū
(securing salvation). (Myth & Śymbuls etc,, p. 110).

XXIV.216d masibī syāk jenu kumkumé susu. J renders it with zśj wasschen
ṭich erin en wrijuen het blanketsel fjn en de curcuma woor de borst (they washed them-
selves therein and ground the cream and curcuma for the breast). I get the
impression here that J seems to have in mind that the girls of Ayodhyā come to
ṭhe river to bathe and to make the curcuma and cream. However, the im-
pression I obtain from reading the Oldjavanese text is that the saffron cream on
the breasts of the girls, perhaps put there the previous night before going to bed,
comes off, when bathing and because of scrubbing. This saffron cream then
brings about the yellowish colour of the water. Hence my translation into wko
bathe [so that] the safṅon cream on their breasts is washed awg. See also my trans-
lation of this stanza in my paper, ‘The Oldjavanese Rāmāyaṇa, its composer
and composition.

XXIV.218. In this stanza J lets Wibhīṣaṇa stand up and take the word,
which is completely against logic. Firstt Wibhṣaṇa interrupts the speech of
Rīma, his superior and benefactor, which is not correct. Secondly in line 4
there is reference to the speaker being victorious. In the Rāmāyaṇa, the battle
between Rāma and Rāwaṇa is never called the battle of Wibhīsaṇa, so that it
is impossible for Wibhīṣaṇa to claim victory. Thirdly, the message is intended
for Bharata, who rules over Ayodhyā while Rāma is away, and whom
Wibhīṣaṇa has never met.

XXIV.219c t-udik manuṅsuṅa. J remarks that t-udik is not found in the
dictionaries. In fact udik is found to the present in the B.I, e.g. pulang ke udik
(to return to one’s place of origin). In this particular place udik means to relurn
via the same route. Hence my translation.

XXIV.221b mustawa. K’s reading is maśrawa and J notes that this
word is not found in the dictionaries. My reading is based on mss BCDEF.

c. kita kārwa ta liṅku ma;siha. The literary translation would be kṣ bot
of you, have merṇ, I usk.

XX]V.224-225. My translation differs so widely with that of J., it is
diffcult to analyse. Likewise stanza 229-230.

XX1V.234a iatulw. The difference in translation here is brought
about by the misinterpretation of the word katulw on J's part ]J obviously
806

understands katulyy as worden worlgeṣet (to be continued). In B.&. it would be
dilanḍjutkan, whilst usually the euivalent of the word katulyw in B.ī. is
terlaṇjur. Here Wibhṣ”aṇa wants to excuse himself for talking so much, or
to justify his long talk, by the reason that he is in fear of being separated from
Rāma.

XX1IV.235. I cannot follow J's translation.

XXIV.240c Janārddhana. It seems incredible to see that Rāma and
Sitā are compared with Janārddhana (Wiṣṇu) alone, while in the following line
they are compared with Kāma and Rati. I feel that the poet juggles with
words here, he might have had in mind Arddhanarī when he wrote Janār-
ddhana, perhaps regarding jana as synonymous with nara. If this notion ig
correct then the comparison is perfect, because in liṇe ś Rāma and Sītā are
said to be dampat1. See about this in stanza 200 d,

XXIV.242-260. Freuently there exists major differences in the trans-
lation ofJ's and mine, which are extremely difñcult to explain. Wherever
possible further notes will be provided.

XXIV.245b pgyuṅ uṇah. J renders it with cen ṛonneschérm van watermoes,
which I do not know. Based on the word wpeh in G  R I1.66-7, I translate
pṇuṅ uyak into ordinaṛy umbrella in contrast with the royal umbrella held by
Nala. Also the colour of the umbrella which js blue-black (wuluṅ) indicateṣ
that it is not a ceremonial umbrella. See e.g. Tke Ocean 9f Śtop, I1.263-72.

XXIV.246b wawāṅirira mus (to carry a golden fan) Jīs rendering
into a batik pattern seems to me to be far-fetched. Zur js a fan according to
G & R. I.l17.

XXIV.248a akurug wraṅ. J could not make sense of it. (See his note
on p. 433, 3k794/1936). My translation which reads carried an armour wiy
triangular patterns is based on G & R. I.66. T[he oraṅ antakusumu, a kind of
armour which in the wgyaṅ is worn by Ghaṭotkaca, the son of Bhima, by which
he obtains the ability tofly, is also believed to have this pattern. (See J.E.
Jasper, *Tengger en Tenggerezen,” II.217-8 in Djawa, 1927, af. 4). According
to Jasper, Sunan Kalijogo obtained a oṭsṅ anlakusuma from the prophet
807

Muhammed s.a.w., which up to the present is inherited by the princes of Sura-
karta and Yogyakarta.

c Késaraṅakusarāhusirĕṅ drĕs. The phrase aṅakusarāṅusirṅ drés must be
understood as an adjectival phrase, such as saṅ mabahu mawiḍaṅ etc. J seems
ṇot to see it this way, with the result that his translation is very hard to com-
prehend.

XXIV.25la sinta. J regards it as a name of a girl Whether he
means Sinta, the Javanese spelling for Sītā, the wife of Rāma is not clear, but
even so it is too ridiculous to imagine. M.W. on pp. 697, 1213, 1214 has a list
of meanings of the word sita, and my translation is based on one found on page
1214. .

XXIV.252b mamisamaṅgamabkawa. I regard this word as being a com-
pound of ma-wisaṅgama-bhawa (the character of people who break up the
marriage), in other words the conduct of adulterors. Concerning this seemingly
misconduct see H. Zimmer, Mytks Ś śymbols, p. 177-9).

ñXīV.257c tan hudāni tu hudān ira littw. J seems to see in the words
hudani and hudan ira as meaning ruin, so that his translation reads kiin regen was
geen regen, naar mijne meening (his rain was not rain, in my opinion). In my view tan
śudani must be understood as meaning not able to be seen, not able to be described, not
able to be imagincd.

XX1V.258 hah hudan prabku jugān pahṇgwu ṅ rā. ]J's translation reads
0l De regen wan een worst werfraait de aarde (Oṭ The rain of a king beautifes the
earth). In my opinion J cannot refer to Indra when he says tke rain ṭf a king; on
the other hand, it is not clear who or what kind of king can claim rain as his
property. My translation reads 4ṅl The rain is the king amongst those [elements]
which are capable of beautifying the world. Different ways of reading the text pro-
duce this variation in translation or create misunderstanding.

XXV.2c akon saṅ haṅ Agastt Jawa r-uṅgu. My reading is based on
mss. BCDEF. Kern's reading is akon saṅ lyaṅ Agusti jala r-uṅgu. There has
been uite a controversy about this line, not concerning the reading of either
jala or jawa, as the scholars concerned in fact do not consult the mss. but just
relying on KUs text, but about the action of the sage Agastya or Agasti or
Agastin. See e.g. CH in B.k.l. 114.365 note 22. CH criticizes the translation
of P. (bewal Agaslya pluats te nemen in het water), in which he says that the text
śhould read uṅgwu instead of uṅgu to justify P's translation. In that case the
808

metre will be faulty. J haye ṭhe opinion that P’s translation j; alright, because
usually after the word akon the veṛb following it are always given the a-areaṛjs
suffix. If it does not occur in this particular place, it is only because the metre
cannot comply with it. (See Zoetmulder, Dr Tual yan ṅu Adśarua, p. 15). J[y
the RK at least, I get the impression that mare comes before grammuy,

The problem I would put forward here is of another nature. It is the
choice between the words jala and jawa. Afer looking up the story in the
Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki (HPS) and Bhaṭṭikāwya¹s translation by Leonardi, [
could not find any episode in which Agastya was mentioned to stay iṇ ṭhe
water (jala), only that on hjs way to the south he ordered the mountain

tioned that he went to the sea aṇḍ never came back (see Sister Nivedita, Myss
9f the Hindus & Buddkists, p. 386-7). [n the Sejarah Melayu there js also men-
tioned about a king called Suran, a descendant of Alexander the Great who
descended into the sea, but in reality he went downṇ to Palembang (Aftabu] >ardṇ)
where he married the princess Mahtabu’l Bahri. (S.M. p- 158). In the cṇṣe
of Agastya we may assume that he too went down to Java aṇd stayed there,
because it is a well-known fact that statues of Agastya are found a,t several
places in Central and Eaṣ Java, dating as early as 760 A.D., when king
Gajayana built the temple of Dinaya. This js weJ before the earliest date pro-
posed so far for the writing of the R.K. whijch js placed under the reign of king
Balituṅ (898-930 AD). Fortunately we alṣo kṇow that at that time the Pram,.
banan temple of Lorojoṅgraṅ was built, where the statue of Agastya was placed
in the southern niche of the main temple. and where on the inner side of ṭhe
balustrade the story of Rāma wasṣ depicted. There haye been some arguments
against the RK being the text followed by the sculpturer of the Śiwa-temple.

reveal that this version might be the model ysed by the engraver(s). (See e,g,
B-R. Chatteṛjee, Indiu anḍ Jawa, 137). Asṣ Poerbatjaraka does not publish the
text of the Agastyaparwa in fuḍ i, his thesis, I would like to put some uota-

that Agastya had indeed come to Java and stayed there. The text below ig
derived from Gonda>s edition (p. 343), though the spelling and translatioṇ ,ye
mine:

hana sira siddha paṇwḍia taruṇa, saṅ Drśdhaṣyu ṅaran ira, anak bhagawān Agasṇa ṅayay

ira, saṅ tumahap agra niṅ Windlaparwar, sambaddha, ri ḍé ṇṇyan alyunft] umyṇ~

-

dalan saṅ kyaṅ Adika, saṅ pinakadidśwg, makakṣiélra Y, awadwṣpamaṇḍala,
809

(There was a young but perfect pundit, called Drêdhasyu, the son of the sage
Agastya, who had stopped the top of the powerful Windhya-mountain to grow,
because it wanted to block the route of the Sun-god, [Agastya]l who was
regarded as ādidéwa (Śiwa), who had his hermitage in the region of the island
of Java).

Jt should be noted that I read umunto, derived from wuntu (to block) instead
of tumunto of Gonda. A mistake, either by the copyist or the transcriber is most
likely, as the Javanese or Balinese letter ta is very much alike with ha. Further
I would like to note that my translation of the word makakṣéra (to have a
hermitage) differs from those of Gonda and P. My rendering is based on the
story of the sage Baradah who is said to have his hermitage in a graveyard
(kṛéra) of Lemah Tulis (See Poerbatjaraka, Calon Arang, BKl. 82).

p. 394: hana saṅ l; naraṇwa, anak saṅ īr¥pawindu ṅaran īra, ikaṅ pinaka-siśya
mami, matapa ṅké Yawadwṭpa maṇḍaa......

(There is another wife[of Pulastya] called Il, a daughter of Trĕṇawindu, who
iṣ a student of mine, who has a hermitage herein the region of the island of
Java).

I use the above passage only to confrm the fact that Agastya is really
believed to have stayed in Java and had established a religious school with
students like sage Trĕṇawindu, which is also known in other Oldjavanese works,
e.g. the Tantu Paṅgelaran.

On the other hand Jawa is also mentioned in the Rāmāyaṇa of Wālmīki,
ṭhat is when Sugrīwa sent his troops to search for Sitā in the eastern region he
said, among others: *O, dwellers in the woods, ṣearch carefully in all these
places that are accessible by climbing and swimming and the Island of the Seven
Kingdoms Yawa, also...... etc.] See 1. HPS. II274. 2. B.|. Chatterjee, Jawa
and Sumatra in Indian Literature, p. 22.

XXV.4d laradakśn. ] renders it with matig (uw vaart)\ (slow down))
CH criticizes the translation ofJ. sharply, because CH argues that Rāma is
supposed to govern the Puṣpaka, not Sītā. CH then translates laradakên into
now it can be assuaged. ī ñnd both translations unsatisfactory, as they overlook the
810

fact that Rāma’s party stops at the lake of Pampām to take a bath. Yet I still
can accept the translation of J., I go even further, to translate laradakun as stop!
Unlike CH who sees in this order something wrong, namely as if Rāma does not
govern (CH’s word) Puṣpaka, but Sītā, I can see here, that it is indeed
Rāma who controls the Puṣpaka. We must bear in mind that Puṣpaka is not
an ordinary aerial car, but in fact a living being which can be ordered to stop
or start.

XXV.5a ta-sibu. CH again criticizes J of overlooking the fact that ta
is an abbreviation of kita (BKī 114.365 note 26). In conseuence of this finding
CH translates kita into us, which I regret to say is unfortunate, because hitu in
Oldjavanese in most cases means the second person, except in very rare
occasions, which I suspect to be a mistake on the part of later copyist. Besides,
the ta in stanza 5a is in fact an imperative form, as is more obvious in CHīs
transcription (t-asibu), no possibility at all to see the / there as ñrst person
plural.

The translation of the last two lines of this stanza is too far-fetched, both
J and CH talk about the restoration of Ayodhyā by either Snā or by Rāma
and Sitā. Ayodhyā does not suffer at all either from the war in Lĕṅkā or due
to the absence of Rāma. More than once Rāma has praised Bharata as being
virtuous and an excellent ruler. As a matter of fact Bharata has improved the
welfare of Ayodhyā.

XXV.7b ri pi-Wi nya. By adding the word riwr in his translation
without placing it in suare brackets, CH creates a distorted picture. In fact he
creates a riwer in this stanza. The particle ṇya here refers to the alas-alus
(forests) in line a. And what is meant by t4i-tśpi ṇy alas here, which I render
with boundaries, is in fact parts of the forest where there are no tall trees.
It can be a clearing or places where the trees do not grow too close to each
other.

c. rāga. The word rāga also confuses CH. Apparently he thinks that
rāga means basket as in B.I., but it seems here that rāga still has its Skt. meaning
(colour, passion, desire, beauty. See MW. p. 872). Perhaps CH is infḍuenced
by the fact that the second raga is read by K with a short a in the Krst
syllable, but if he takes into consideration the guru-laghu, then he will discover
that the writer is compelled to spell it with a short a in order to obtain a
laghu.
811

XXV.8b patiga ṇa kapwa tinan¥m tankman.. ]J in his word list, p. 251,
referring to RK, VIlI.54. Nag. VIII.2 and other places renders the word patigs
,with plaweils wloer (pavement, oor). CH:in BKI 114.366 renders patiga with
wompound. . ṣ J

I, the above line it is impossible to render the word patiga with pavement or
floor. In stanza 13d the phraṣe reads ri sisi nin patiga, and there is still a chance
that patiga might mean pavement, floor, or compound or field as I suggest in
my translation: Tīhe phrase in RKu VIIl.54; reads patiga nya rmarkata manik
makiris, also might support Js rendering. I translate the word patigu:in this
particular line into yard. The phrase in Nag. VIII2 referred to by J reads
patigan ika binajralépa, maputik, which is translated by Pigeaud into its parapet is
diamond-plastered, white. (See Jawa i in the 14th centuṇ, 7, I11.9) Concerning the
word patiga, Pigeaud II.19 elaborates as follows: Patiga is a technical term of
architecture..ī... - In the case of the watch-tower, patiga can only refer to the
parapet around the open top. I- cannot aagree with Pigeauds translation of
bingjralépa into diamond plustered, because in my opihion, even if Majapahit wés
ṣo wealthy and Hayam Wuruk so extravagant, he would not decorate the walls
of a watch tower with diamonds. Therefore I agree with J which renders patiga
with plaweisel (pavement), and I suggest bingjralépa means to be paved with stones,
bgjra meaning hurd.

XXV.10b kala yar kwaṅ kgyu kuāit kawalot. CH reads kalgyar which he
renders with we fwat and it seems that he renders kawalot with entwined. 1 render
kala yar with sometimes and kawalot with surrounded, because the curcuma-plants
are no creepers.

c. camera. 2 CH renders it with byfuloes, whilst I translate it into yaks.

. Perhaps CH thinks there are no yaks in Indonesia, but as Zoetmulder points

out, the scene of the Rāmāyaṇa in Kawi is not set in Java or Indonesia,

though there are enough evidence that some details refer to Java (see Initro-
duction).

XXV.12c , padkwūharan. . In a note about the padéwākaran of Indrajit,
Nikumbdhila, I suggest that padéwĕharan should be rendered with sacrifieial ground,
though I translate it into temple ( déwagrtha J, becalse it appears that padéuū-
haran seems to be regarded as synonymous with dkwagrśha, though perhaps in the
sense of pahoman (offerings-place). CH renders the word padéwāharan with inwo-
cation to the gods.
812

XXV.13b pikatan. I do not agree with CH who renders pikatan with
decoy-bird, because in my view it is the name of a kind of bird, while a decoy-
bird can be any bird used as bait to catch a bird of its kind. And what reason
is there for the existence of decoy-birds at a hermitage, where all the animals
are tame, and who would be engaged in such a low profession as hunting (for
birds) is the occupation of caṇḍalus. Would a brahmin in the hermitage of the
sage Bharadwāja, then allow himself to carry on such debased practices?

XXV-15cd niralpkṣa sakṣaṇa mĕtu ṅ kahar, mar¥gi ṅ maré sira mamrik
magiraṅ (without regard [to anything] all his wishes come true in seconds, satis-
fying everyone who comes to stay). CH renders the two lines above with ṅis
deliberations easily and instantly bring forth fulfilment; he satiates those who approach him,

genth and jṇ/ul.

My translation is based on the belief that these lines contain an illusion to
the power of the sage Bharadwīāja, e.g. when he entertains Bharata and his
followers, and Rāma>s wish at the end of his return journey in the Rāmāyaṇa of
Wālmiki (See HPS. ITI.353-5).

CHs rendering seems not to contain a trace of relation to these episodes I
mention.

XXV.l6bcd. CH seems to miss the point here. Line a says that the sage
Bharadwāja is so perfect, that everybody near him becomes wise. Line c even
says that the animals too are influenced by the sage Bharadwāja and strive for

.knowledge. CH’s translation gives a confused picture of the whole thing. And
from here on, because CH seems not to be able to comprehend the situation in
the community of animals in the hermitage in their pursuit of knowledge it is
plain perplexity. This kind of description can still be found freuently in the
wgyaṅ literature, the Serat Cĕnṭini and the like. I cannot give a full account of
CH’s translation. Whenever possible I will forward a note, but the heedful
reader is bidden to consult CHs article *From Laṅkī to Ayodhyā by Puṣpaka¹,
in BK1 114.

XXV.2lc baka. This word is found twice in linec. CH obviously
holds the view, that both have the same meaning, so that his translation reads
the baka—herors...... cease to acl as herons, whilst in fact the Krst baku means
erane, heron etc. and the second baka means deceilful, eunning etc. (See M.W., p.
719).
813

XXV.25a hkgyan. 7This word should be read hgwm (water-hen). The
mistake has perhaps its origin in the fact that m-n-ṅ in ]kt (the anuswāra) is
interchangeable, and the desire of the poet or the copyist to use alliteration.
CH becomes lost here, perhaps because his thought is tied up to the word hkgyan
(epilepsy)

XX.29d ikaṅ isṭi Kālu tu iniṣṭi nika (they want to become worshippers
of Kāla).  Perhaps this is a clue to the existence of the Kālacakra in
Indonesia, known already since the time of Balituṅ or perhaps even long before
then, as the Borobudur temple is already known to be tantric in character.

XXV.30b wadśatā. It seems that the correct reading is wasitā (un-
bounded power. M.W,, p. 929) in accordance with mss BEF. My translation
js based on this reading. CH seems to render it with power too

XXV.31d aṣguṇs iṣki. CHīs note, which says that aṣlaguṇa is the
Javanese aṣlagina, a manik, a jewel etc. (BKI 114.370 note 54) is misleading
and temerarious. In my view the word aṣtaguṇa still has its original Skt meaning.
The phrase is aṣlaśuṇa isṭi, meaning an oblation consisting of butter, fruit etc., opposed
ṭo the sacrifiee of animals. See M.W. p. 169 for iṣi and M.W. p. 357 for aṣlaguṇa.
Hence my translation into ṇfering which consists of eight kinds 9f ingredients.

XXV.33c luluy maṅidaṅ. The words maṅidaṅ means literally to liwe us a
dear, that is to Live on plants/vegetables. In N}J. it is called tapa ṅidaṅ There are
many types of takus, a.o. tapa ṅidaṅ and tapa ṅaloṅ=(to live as a deer and to
live as a bat). On doing the tapa ṅaloṅ one should tie his legs on a branch of a
tree and hang upside down as a bat. This kind of tpa (asceticism) seems to be
the one practiced by Rāwaṇa in the Hikṇut Sri Ramu (ed- W.G. Shellabear, p.l-
9). Perhaps the vow of Gajah Mada not to eat palapa (tan pamaṅan palapa, Para-
yaton, p. 26-9) meaning nué lo eat spices, in N.J. mutik, belongs also to this kind of
asceticism.

XXV.37. Here again CH loses ṭhe details of the story, as he mentions
in his translation that Srtā has left Rāma, on the banks of the Tamasā-river,
whilst what actually happens is that Rāma followed by Lakṣmaṇa and Sitā have
lej Sumantrī (the prime minister of Ayodhyā) and all the people following them
from Ayodhyā. As a result of this misconception, CH's translation is incompre-
hensible.

XXV40la nimna. ī render it with suppressed, based on the meanings
found in M.W. on p. 551, which a.o. lists depressed, sunk, downward. CH renders
it with prṇfound.
8lś

' b,; aṅumbah(one bathing). : In my view this word rePers tg the bṇthing
girls mentioned in stanzas 50-55. Also see stangas 78-81, especially stanza 80,
CH renders aṅumbak with purifeation denoting the actions of the priests, and
comes into diffculties with the translation of the following ḍines, because he
has followed a false lead. See eg. line 41b, which ends in a guestion mark.

c. ulam got. CH renderṣ it with got-fish, obviously assuming that the
word ulam means fs, as in N.J. kramu for iwak. In my view the word ulum
means young leaves or uegetable eaten raw, as it is a desirable diet for yogis. See e.g.

Desmond Dunne, Yoṛa made eay, ch. XII, esp. pp. 144-7).

d. Jt seems that there is a belief that unsalted food 'minimised the sex-
urge, which helps considerably in the wakening of the- kupfalim śaks,. (See S.
Siwanṅnda, Sure wagys for Śuccess in Life and God-Realisaljon,p. 223). J

. XXV.44. Differences in the,reading generates differences in ‘ranslation
here, e.g. r-anli is read by CH asṣ ranki, nanme of a kind of fruit, and CH becomes
daubtful of his translation, karaṅraṅ (emotional person) and paṅ i (the branches
are...) are also regarded as names of plants. u

XXV48d dumahukwn tuhuma  [ js obvious that CH does not know the
' meaning of this phrase, because it is a word in the language of the peasant. Aṣ
a son of a village chief, I heard the phrases tahun iki ora dadi, tahun iki ora mṣtop;
and the like freguently. The meaning is that the crop at that particular year
is unsuccessful etc. As these mishaps always had a great impact on the life of
the people, I can remember it very easily. Ifthe crop failed, it was not only
the people that suffered, but also my father and my family, leading for
īnstance in the delay of the payment of my school fees, lack of food etc,.

XXV.50a taṅ[w]g. - Kīṣ reading is taṅś, which is , rendered -by J and
CH with bruad, as shown in, thejir translations. I am pretty suṛe of my reading,
because in my view Rāma asks Sītg to bend down, to look more closely. If jt
is only to look at the river Sarayū, Sītā does not need to Jook closely. The
reason that Rāma wants Sītā to bend down is to see the wlur of ṭhe water, [ṭ
seems very trivial, but it proves detrimental to J's and CH>s translations.

XXV.50. Here agaiṅ my translation and that of CH has proceeded inṇ
opposite directions. In my translation the birds are warning the girls who have
lost their kains, in CH¹s the girls are imitating the bird.
815

īXXV.58. CH remarks that the story of the heron here is an allusion to
the story of the heron in Pañcatantra or the Javano-Balinese Tantri, but does
not give the exact story referred to. I looked it up in the Pañcatantra by A.W.
Ryder, and find the story of ‘The Heron that liked Crab meat’ on p. 76-81.
The only difference is that the heron is killed by the crab, while in the RK,
ṭhe kuntul tries to rescue the heron, but fails because of the interference
of a prawn. The death of the heron is not stated. In Bali, there are
still statuettes of wood or buffalo horns made, representing this motive of the
story.

XXV.l1a dalup akon. Instead of reading dalup akon, CH reads dalupak
and cannot go further, and this matter affects his translation of the last three
Jines of the stanza. The word manéka in line d should be regarded as a variation
of anéka (not one; not once), not derived from the root nêk (to climb) as seen in
CH’s translation.

XXV.63d liṅsa. CH renders this word with tke ticks. According to
ṭhe Oxford dictionary a tik is an insecl parasitic on various animals. In
Javanese, the word liṅsa means the egg of ticks, in this case the tick is a
louse.

XXV.65d wilalan. [J renders it with glazemaker (dragonfly). See Js
Wl, p. 542. CH follows J's rendering. Also he does not regard alap-alap (mind
the reduplication) as a kind of bird. I cannot agree with him that the daṛṇwus-
bird eats dragonflies. It is a kind of put¥r and eats grain. On the other hand
] regard alug-alup as a hawk, and a hawk will never ṣatisy itself with dragonñies
and grasshoppers. The picture I obtain from the stanza is, that a couple of
burwak-birds with their young (wilalan) were looking for food under a tree. Then
a hawk swooped down to catch one of the wilalans. The parent, the burwak-birds,
raised an alarm, but the putêr and daṇṇus could not help, and out of fear hid
ṭhemselves on a branch, sitting close together, perhaps covered by leaves. We
see e.g. in the story of king Śiwi, the hawk and the dove, that the hawk claims
ṭo feed on doves etc. '[his would explain the fear of the pukr and daṛṇyas-
birds.

XXV.68c wruh-wruh. ]J regards wruh-wruh as a kind of tree (see Wl,
p.561). CH is more confdent and identifes the tree with the wru-tree, perhaps
bearing in mind the waru or w¥rutrees. I cannot get rid of my first impression
ṭhat the writer wants to say something about the ability of the monkey in jump-
ing, but sometimes causing trouble to other animals, because of the mischievous
character of the monkey.
816

XXV.72a Ulĕṅis. L¥ṅs in NJ. is a kind of mango. Hence I identify
Lśis-lṅis with a tree. G ñ R. I1.173 explains lśṅis as the name of a kind of
teak-tree. On the other hand CH identiñes alśsśs with a tree, perhaps in
accordance with J's Wl p. 496 which reads leses-naam van een boom (name
of a tree), but I suspect the prefx a-, which is also used to form an adjective.

XXV.82d riṇḍèṅ. I think CH is correct in assuming riṇḍṅ to be the
ḍénṅṅ of today, because my mother used to dry the drnêṅ exactly like what is
mentioned in this stanza, that is the meat is strung together and the string is
then fastened to a piece of bamboo, so that it looks like a bow. The bow is
then fixed above the fire in the kitchen when it rains or placed in the sun hang-
ing together with the clothes, after they are washed. This precaution is taken
to prevent the cat stealing the meat.

XXV.85c mapiñjuṅ, to wear the kain in a way that it also covers the
breast, leaving the calves of the legs exposed. See G ñ R I1.204. CHīs trans-
Jation is confusing by the loss of this word.

XXV.88b uatgp satuta. I render atap with dense(ly). See J's Wl. p.227.
CH seems to regard it as meaning roḍf as in the B.I.

XXV.9b6c tuṅgaṅan. CH renders it with wehicl, but in Oldjavanese
it usually means korse, and by failing to understand it as such, he is at a loss.

XXW¥.98d *kakhwyan hiwaṅ iṅ rat ratu-ratu niṅ arām wanwa ṇya winuwus. This
expression has more or less the same meaning as *home sweet homeK or the
Indonesian expression which reads kyjan emas negeri orang, hujan keris lembing negeri
sendiri, baik juga negeri sendiri, which means ewen if we are syḍering in our own county,
and enjṇ a good life in a foreign countyy, we still feel that our own countyy is the best.

XXV.100. See also my translation of this stanza in my article *The word
tgji in the Rāmāyaṇa Kakawirī.

XXV.102c waru. J renders it with naam van een boom (name of a tree).
I think it is unlikely. Perhaps J's rendering is based on G  R. IT.13. If Jis
correct then line d which reads kadi papraṅan hiḍśp (seems there would be a fght)
will not ft the context. So I think warul should be an animal which could put
up a good fight against the spider. The thought of this ight arouses emotional
feelings in Rāma’s heart, which is mentioned in 1lines a and ś. In fact
Rāmaīs heart is filled with anxiety, like someone who is riding on a horse, but
the harness is broken and the control of the horse depends entirely on that part
of the harness, which is made of woven cloth. See this expression used by Swami
S. Sivananda in Sure Wgys for Success in Life etc., p.ī14.
817

XXV.106a ṅ parahu pan parahu. The proa (parahu) is indeed a means
of transport (para-hu) is the literal translation of the term.

XXV.108. CH remarks that he is not convinced by Aichele’s translation,
which is not available to me, so I cannot give my judgement. However, while
doubting the translation of Aichele, CH cannot give his own translation, in my
yiew because he fuils to see in the word kumara, the god of war Kumāra, the son
of Śiwa. I once went along with people catching lobsters at Ujung Kulon on
the western tip of Java, and the way they caught the lobsters is similar to that
mentioned in this stanza.

XXV.111. I cannot describe CH’s translation of this stanza particularly
in comparison with mine, e.g. tan ari (all the time, without bounds), read by K.
hinari is rendered by CH as belowed wife, while the stanza is talking about a horse
laden with a too heavy burden of oil, salt and rice. It seems that the further I
go in reading CHs translation, the more perplexed I become, and my impression
is that CH while translating the stanzas was also in despair, bewildered by re-
petition of words and alliterations.

XXVI.lb salawas iṅ maṅjanma. J renders it with zoo lang als men gich
śncarneert in lewende lijue (as long as there are people on earth). I am not sure of
my rendering of J's translation. I regard Ayodhyā as the subject of the verb
maṅjanma, hence my translation of the phrase into sincr its foundation.

d. sambéga. It seems to me that the N,J. meaning of the word is more
appropriate in this context than the Skt one. (See G  R I.875 and M.W. p.
1115). I base my translation of the word on G ĕ R, whilst J seems to found
his rendering on the Skt meaning. Perhaps J is influenced by the following
stanza, concerning the people in turmoil etc., whilst I prefer to stick to the com-
parison with the mood of an ascetic etc.

XXVlI3c hinuakĕn. Kīs text reads hanw and J remarks that this word
is not found in the dictionaries. My reading is based on ms. B, while mss.
CDEF have kśnirakin. We can safely assume that the flaw in CDEF can be
ascribed to the copyist.

XXVI4a wads hya. J reads wadahu ya but does not understand what
it means. Hence his confused translation. Wadu is derived from wad (to say, to
speak) and kyu is a variant of kṇa.
818

XXVl6bd risor nikaṅ ha. J remarks that he cannot fnd the meaning
of the word āā in the dictionaries. I translate it into a kā-tree/plant, with the
understanding that kāis an abbreviation ofa name of a tree/plant, e.g. kāno
(palm-tree), kandoṅ (calodracon Jaḍuinia), humbawuṅ (mango-tree) and 4#aru (hg-
treel. Amongst these, the most probable plants or trees that grow near a river
is the handoṅ and the kara.

XXVl.7. See my translation of this stanza in my paper, titled 7âe
Oldjawanese Rāmĕyayu, its composer and its eomposition. In my view line 4 refers to
Rāma and Sīt, and not to Bharata as J's translation suggests.

XXV1.8d ndu l-unśmbak tan śmbiṅ. J overlooks the word tan in tan ṣmbiṇ.
Hence his translation into en ween (and cry).

XXVI.11-16. I cannot compare my translation with CH’s becauṣe he
seems not so sure about his which is evident from the numerous guestion marks
and lacunae in the translation.

XXVI.18d r-usapi ṅ raki. My translation and that of J are literal
translations, which sounds a bit strange, but if one watches a dance performance
of the wayaṅ-oraṅ, one still can see traces of this in the hand movements of the

dancers at similar scenes.

XXVI.19-20. See also my translation of these stanzas in my paper ‘The
Oldjavanese Rāmāyaṇa, its composer and its composition’.

XXVI.22. This stanza has been translated by J. (BKī. 94/1936) and P
(TBG. 72/1932), but I give up to compare my translation with theirs. The
translation of stanzas 22-26 is not very exact, as there are too many words used
in the text that do not need to be translated as they are repetitive phrases.
Besides, in many cases I am not sure. May later translators be more fortunate,
perhaps by comparing similar passages in the other kakawins and even with
more recent products of literature such as Serat Centini, the babads, pañji-stories

etC.

XXVI.25a baṇḍa Baṇḍira. At frst I translated buṇḍa with a crippled
attendant of the court, bearing in mind that he is the euivalent of an aśdidulem
palawja or kalawjja in the kratons of Surakarta and Yogyakarta. These abdidulem
palawṣu are in appearance ugly, usually they are disfgured people, but believed
to have great mana which can complement the power of the king. But then [
have the notion that he is the jester of the court, in the Javanese courts he may
819

be compared with an abdidalem cantaṅ baluṅ. See Stutterheim's ‘Oudheidkundige
Aanteekeningen’, BK~. 92(1935).181-211. Perhaps baṇḍu is a mixture of the Skt
words paṇḍu (weakling, eunuch) and paṇḍā (wisdom, learning, knowledge). See
M.W. p.580. Perhaps the name Baṇḍira is derived from waṇḍara (eunuch). See
M.W,, p9l5. J translates baṇḍu into kansworst (kok)

c. jalaṇḍaka M.W. on p.415 renders it with watereggs, the fṛ ḍffsh 1I
think roe ṇffsh. I think fsh ree, the eggs of water-living beings (fsh) is a better
rendering.

XXV1.29a madulur. ] render it with thereupon. J renders it with met
2jjn broeder which is utterly wrong, because Rāma is going to his bedroom where
Ṣīta has been waiting for him. Js translation of the following stanzas conse-
guently gives a totally different picture.

XXVI1.39b sśmbahakśn démakan ri naréndra. Without knowledge of the
customs of the Javanese/Balinese courts, this line is difñcult to understand. The
fact is that gueen Sītām gives presents to Trijaṭā, mentioned in stanza 38. In
stanza 39, Trijaṭā receives the presents from Sītā by making a sĕmbak and ex-
pressing gratitude (sśmbah nuwun). The preposition ri can mean to as well as
from. So it is not correct to think that Trijaṭm also gives presents to the gueen
in return at that time. The gifts of Trijaṭā are in the form of tribute and have
been offered at the time of arrival.

XXVI.50. Now and again in the past I have wondered why the RK
goes not contain a mākātmya. Even in my latest paper on the RK, titled ‘The
Oldjavanese Rāmāyaṇa, its composer and composition, I still adhere to the
accepted view, that reading of the RK only benefits the yogiśwaras and the syjanas.
Afer translating the whole kakawin it dawns on me that the meaningof the most
intricate lines at the end of the story, reading as follows: ,yaklgwās ucapanta riṅ
juluṅ adomuka pinaka-nimitta niṅ los (if it iṣ read to unfortunate people, either
Jow or high in rank, they will understand it beyond doubt which will ultimately
Jead them to heavenly Bliss). J's rendering is: Helder en duideljjk iin uwe woorden:
wor de ongelukskinderen met afgewend geluat is het de oorāaak der verlossing, whilst P.
ṭranslates the same line as follows: Śtellig ṛal Uwe dfnitie van wat noodlotlig is en van
het tegenowergestelde eruan, duidelijk ṭjn, helgeen een uoorteeken is van (hel bereiken uan) ket
yolmaakte. 1 will leave these lines untranslated.

Soewito Santosoo RāMāYANA-KAKAWIlN, text, translation, introduction
and notes. Hardbound, volumes l, 2, 3,124-856 pages. Price Rs. 600
for three volumes.

The Rāmāyaṇa-Kakawin consisting of 26 chapters containing 2778 stanzas
is the biggest and greatest amongst works in Old Javanese poetic literature. It
is for the Krst time published in Roman script and translated fully into English,
which opens new horizons for further study in various ñelds of language,
religion, customs and tradition etc not surveyed before. The editor and trans-
lator has been a student as well as lecturer in the feld for more than 25 years,
and has translated various Old Javanese literary works such as Sutasoma, Calon
Arang, Nirarthaprakrĕta and others.

Śoewito Santosoo SUTASOMA, text, translation, introduction and notes.
Hardbound, 655 pages.

The Sutasoma-Kakawin, also called Puruṣada-śānta (The Maneater
pacifed) is only second in size but not in beauty after the Rāmāyaṇa-Kakawin,
amongst the Old Javanese literary products. The original author, Mpu
Tantular, in contrast to that of most of the kakawins, was an ardent buddhist
scholar who attempted skilfully to uphold the grandeur of Buddhism in a land
ruled by a Śaiwatic king. Scholars of the past had assumed that it is evident in
the Sutasoma about the confuence of Buddhism and Śaiwaism. In the introduc-
tion the present author looks at the matter as a court case. The scholars in the
past accused Tantular/Sutasoma, as defendant, of mixing up Buddhism and
Śaiwism. The present author, regarding himself as defender of Sutasoma
pleads for the acḍuittance of the defendant by calling as witnesses other Old
Javanese works, such as Śang Hyang Kamāhāyanikan, Kuñjarakarṇa, Nāgara-
krêtāgama, Tantu Panggĕlaran etc, even the inscription of Kĕlurak, besides the
Sutasoma itself. The verdict is up to the reader.
