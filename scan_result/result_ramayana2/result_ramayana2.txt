The demon-soldiers dispersed to all directions, wailing. They flew up into
the sky when their dwellings caught fire and completely burnt to ashes. The
elephant tied up to a pole was in distress, menaced by the fire. Likewise
was the horse, all by itseli nobody was riding it. It attempted to leap
away from the overwhelming fre.

many trained starlings, parrots, sṣyuṅs, and guails were killed in their cages
at the pavilions of gold, as nobody cared for them. Everyone cared only
for oneself. A she-demon was leaving [her house], shouting: cah, ah, aah,
groaning sadly when she saw a demon almost falling into the fre. [The
demon] was very stupid and almost killed.

Thus was [the description] of Lĕṅkā on fre, and the destruction of the
nāgapuṣpa-trees in the garden. The mandaras, aśoka, punnāga trees were
ruined, their leaves, flowers and branches burnt. The taṇjuṅ, manggo,
ambawaṅ, coconut, and mgja trees were crushed, the jambu and rambutun trees
were burnt. Durian, manggosteen, puṛṇyan and breadfruit trees were affected
by the fre and all of them were completely spoilt.

As Lĕṅkā was annihilated and-burnt to ashes, Hanūmān lept swiftly back
to the garden of Aśoka to wait upon Sitā. He soon arrived- He saw her,
love-lorn and weeping; her hairknot was in disorder and always loose.
There under the aśoka-tree she moaned, sitting with her head bent, bur-
dened by unbearable despondency.

b. E nyā. d. B mājar-ajar i.

Bāyuputra came forward respectfully [and knelt] at the feet of Jānakī and

. then spoke: °O, my lady, I am Māmruti, I am really the messenger of Rāma-

bhadra. Do not doubt that I am the messenger of Raghutanaya, as you
can see by many evidence. Well, I must ask your leave to return to con-
vey your message to the great king Rāmābhirāma [the handsome Rāma].

Thus said Bāyuputra, then he set off after making obeisance with folded
hapds. He flew up into the sky and assumed an amazing and enormous
size. Excited and gruesome in appearance, he roared, rumbling like thun-
der, the thunderstorm was hissing and sizzling in the sky which was full of
it. The deities were shocked.

The water of the seas splashed and dashed uproariously brought about by
the wind following Hanūmān. The inhabitants of the seas were shocked,
and the dragons were aroused, moving their bodies and uttering deafening
noises. The wind blew hard, trees were uprooted, the mountain of
Mahéndra was shaking. All the monkeys waiting there were in confusion,
fearing the arrival of a mighty opponent.

When Hanūmān was nearly there, the sea swelled and the waves grew
heavy. They broke against the trees on the banks, which were then bereft
of branches and beautiful lowers. The flowers fell to the ground in heaps,
like a bed of fowers, soft, and fragrance was spreading everywhere. Excited
the kinnaras came to make love on the flowers until they were exhausted.

When he arrived at the place where he had left all the monkeys behind to
wait [for him], Jāmbawān, Aṅgada and Nīla came to welcome him followed
by all the other monkeys. ‘Clearly he is successful they said. He,
Hanūmāmn, did not say anything, but he smiled nicely. That was how the
monkeys came to know.

All the monkeys were looking closely at the evidence on Bāyuputra’s body.
They saw the arrow sticking in his thigh, which was the proof that he had
been fghting. The monkeys were very excited about that, they gaped at
the sight of so much evidence. *Ahl Onlya hero is capable of enduring
the pain as he did it on purpose to decorate his body.

b. C muñcak. c. ABCD yśbkanolah. d. C saharṣa muji-muji.

Because of his enormous size he can be regarded as a mountain, his breast
is the slopes [of the mountain]. His long thick hair is the forest, his head
is the peak. The arrow sticking in his body is a snake, his wounds the
caves, and the blood the dkātu (red chalk). Thus said the monkeys happily,
praising [him] aloud, talking together fervently.

d. ABCDE maṅka yan tuṣṭikān ton.

Because they were excited, the monkeys could be likened to the slopes of
the Méru-mountain, because the movement of their red hair was like the
golden creepers, blowing in the wind. Their blinking eyes were like cryst-
als of candrakānta-stones and other precious stones. Because of their delight
at the sight of Hanūmān, they were in tears which was like the amrĕta
(nectar).

When the monkeys were assembled around him, Marutaputra told them
the news, saying: ‘Princess Sītā is found- She is alive and stays in Lĕṅkm,
thus he said. The monkeys were the more rejoiced when they heard the
news about the princess. Their delight was really great. The swelling of
their hearts [out of joyl] was comparable to the swelling of the sea at
full-moon.

Time passed. Hanūmān together with all the monkey heroes went home
as speedy as possible. When they arrived at the mountain of Windhya,
happily they eat fruit and had a rest for a while.

love-sickness of Lord Rāma is the intense darkness that is destroyed by him.

So Hanūmān soon arrived at the high mountain of Mālyawān and met

They were wearing clothes of tree-bark and had a benign appearance. They
had their hair plaited and carried an elephant hide over their shoulders.
They appeared holy and truthful, regularly practicing samādhki (abstract
meditation). They were the partial manifestations of Nārāyaṇa, who was
in fact Wiṣṇu.

Prince Rāma saw, that together with the crest-jewel, there was a letter,
which to him was like the soul of his wife, come to console his longing and
to stop his sorrow.

‘Anilātmaja is a good and excellent messenger. That crest-jewel could
produce everything a person wishes, thus spoke Raghuputra praising
Mgāmruti and he was no longer upset.

God Rāma was very happy to see the letter, with the beautiful handwriting

gave him immeasurable pleasure.

‘If I look at it, my heart is overcome by pangs of love and longing because
I cannot see you. Please, my lord Rāmadéwa, listen to my lamentations,
perceive my great devotion as I keep no-one else in my mind but you. Only
my lord I would always serve in these following seven incarnations.

‘Formerly when there was no news at all about you and your safety, I
thought of nothing else than to die as I regarded my life as useless. Because
of my sorrow, I did not care whether it was the fre or the rock or the sea
which should be the means to terminate my liff. My heart was deter-
mined, clear and freed from attachments.

‘Everything that formerly was nice became tasteless. A garden full of
flowers was not a cure for my longing. All that sounded sweet and every-

enter my throat.

Or [perhaps] he was just generous to the world, which was very sad, as it

As the day broke, the lover was aroused again. He woke up noisily to
make use of the [last moments of the] night, to make love and to embrace
[his wife], as they loved each other very much. They both were fond of
amorous play and were very skilled in sex.

The wife was upset and angry, pretending not to go along. When her

They stopped moving, their limbs trembled, their eyes closed. The husband
was fondling the bosoms of his wife, which were hard and stif. They were
unaware of their surroundings, they were as if in a state of unconsciousness.
öweat was pouring out, wetting their bodies.

Afer they gained consciousness, they opened their eyes and groaned from

The god of Love, Kāma [can feel] very satisñed, everywhere in the three-

openly and brutally, and were eually haughty. Their waists were small,
if drawn in were exactly like a lion’s; their beards were curly and their
mustaches red.

Thereupon the great and most important ministers moved forward to make
their audience, the most senior amongst them was the prime minister, the
wellknown Prahasta. He was exceedingly resolute, and renowned as a
courageous hero, wise and discreet and adept in statesmanship.

c. AD céṣṭa.

He was accompanied by his attendants and relatives on his way to the
audience hall, they were good-looking and knew how to behave properly in
the presence of kings, stately and versed in all sign-languages, experienced
in everything that should be known by a good attendant.

His guards who had rank marched forward, in front, one thousand in
ṇumber; their troops, the ordinary soldiers who were loyal, were ten
thousand in number, marching in solid column. The rearguard marched
by ,countless in number, in units the one after the other, resembling a flood
on the road.

The royal suare which was extremely vast was the ocean, the uncompara-
ble perfect gates were the reet. All the people making their audience
stopped outside the gates, resembling the overfow of the ood which could
not fiow further because of a dam.

The attendants and soldiers who were gathering tributes [to the king]
assembled outside the gates in greater number than before. Not to be
mentioned were the people who saw the amazing things they had never
ṣeen before, which were a great deal amongst the tributes, e.g.

An elephant, untamed, ferce and noless brutal [than the demons]- Any
mman would be astounded to see him, and would be killed if he dared to
fght the beast. [The elephant] was a tribute from a powerful hero, who
was unegualled in his knowledge about taming elephants.

There was one who was an expert in taming exceptional steeds, namely the
knowledge of how to break in a ferce wild horse, which could run as swif
as an arrow or as swif as thought even. This too was amongṣt the tribute
of horses awaiting presentation.

Furthermore there was a hero whose tribute was, amazingly, wild animals,
e.g- rhinoceroses, enormous pythons, lions, bears, and tigers. They carried
them by ten at a time, without cages. To them their tribute of lions was
merely like turtles.

Some had just returned from the abode of Indra, plundering it. Everything
they could find in Indra’s heaven, they took away. Now they came back,
bringing home heavenly fruit which tasted like the nectar of immortality,
extrcmely benefcial unknown to men.

Others had returned with fowers of the parjaia- trees, together with its
young and soft leaves. They took them all away, to the sorrow of the
deities, as nothing had been left behind. The deities were afraid and terror-

Thereupon, afer they had presented all the tributes they waited upon king
Daśāsya who came out to sit on a jewelled throne. The flower-ornaments
and other ornaments he wore were made of gold and jewels. His black
complexion made him look like the fashing clouds of doom.

On his appearance at the audience hall, the gong had been beaten in swif

presence, moving forward respectfully with bent heads and downcast eyes.
They took their seats in front of Rāwaṇa in the middle of the audience hall.

The obligation of a son was [always] in his mind, besides his unweary

His mother saw him, her heart was filed with happiness to see her son
coming on his way to the audience. She came forward to speak to
Wibhīṣaṇa. Her words had as purpose the happiness of the world.

“The world is as añicted by poison. Your brother Rāwaṇa is like the

“Therefore it is better that you speak to your brother Rāwaṇa. I say, he

by him.

Thus were the words of his mother, urging him to give advice [to Rāwaṇa].
Wibhīṣaṇa was willing to do it, because he already had planned to talk to
him, he was only waiting for the order from his mother.

beautifully decorated as never before.

Assuming that he was not bound by the snake-arrow, then you could say

demons. But he was already bound tightly. The only conclusion to take
as to how he could be so violent was, that he is mighty.

When Daśāmsya kept silent, his grandfather Sumāmlī by name, took the word.
He was a grandfather on his mother’s side, very wise and experienced in

*Rurthermore a religious man, a wiku, does not crave of petty things, but
what you want is nothing else but pleasure and enjoyment. You do not
want to strive for knowledge. If that is what you want, it is better that
you cease to be a wiku (sage).

The noble wise man, though manhandled like that, kept his head. His

So he went away with his troops to take refuge with Raghutanaya. They

went by air, flying to the north in the direction of the mountain of
Mahéndra.

They flew over the most dangerous ocean and arrived at [the other] side of

alert, as they thought that it was Daśamukha coming.

Quickly Pawanasuta looked at him, and at closer look he recognised him.
' He smiled and stepped forward to meet him. He remembered his kindness

from days gone by.

He remembered the conduct of the noble prince, also his virtue as a pundit

who loved other people. He did not forget the [little] kindness he had

received, let alone the big ones, they remained forever in his mind.

b. D raya. c. B sakarĕp.

Formerly he felt that Wibhīṣaṇa had a liking for him, and he regarded it
as a mark of affection as large as a mountain. He wanted to reward him
[for thiṣ], as it is in the nature of a noble man to repay kindness rendered

to him.

He was asked to inform the victorious Raghusuta of his [Wibhīṣaṇa’s]
arrival to render his devotion. Pawanasuta on hearing the reuest went
away to wait upon the prince.

“The most outstanding Wibhīṣaṇa has come to render his service without
reservation at the feet of my lord. 1It is certainly better to accept him as he
is noble and virtuous, conversant in scriptures and formulas and may be-

come a good ally.

He was always wise and unwavering in his principles to love and to give
shelter to whoever might come to ask for itt Even an enemy who begs for
his life will be saved. He was really an outstanding person who excelled
in magnanimity.

Api tuwi sira saṅ mamalaku śaraṇa,

Moreover this one seeking refuge was a man of the highest integrity. It was
better that he be granted his reḍuest and taken into his ranks, to bring
great happiness. Thus was Rāma¹s intention.

Huwus inajarakĕn ta sira dadi masö,
praṇata ri suku saṅ prawara Raghusuta,
satama nira tĕḍuh jaladhi mari humuṅ,
marahakĕna panĕmwa nira suka magöṅ.

As he was told [that his reguest for shelter had been granted] he moved
forward [to pay tribute] respectfully at the feet of the hero Raghusuta.

'When he entered his presence, the ocean abated and was very calm, signi-

fying that he would find great fortune.

Atha huwus apagĕh tikana gati nira,

Thus, when his purpose was obtained and his reuest for refuge was
granted, his heart was as if sprinkled with the nectar of immortality; as one
on a journey had found shelter was the eual of his happy feelings.

Let us leave Wibhīṣaṇa staying [with the monkeys], Prince Raghūttama
was pondering over a way to cross the ocean. He was very much troubled,
as he seemed unable to find a solution.

He was depressed as he saw no way out, and this gave rise to bewilderment
which was inherent in him as a mortal. He regarded the ocean as an
obstacle, an obstruction that barred his way [to Lĕṅkā].

The words of outstanding elderly pundits were true, that love and affection
could give rise to hatred. Raghuputra was overwhelmed by pangs of love
for his wife, his anger was aroused by the sea which hindered him.

The anger entered his heart and covered it thoroughly. It was as hot as

again, till at length he stood up and put an arrow on his bow.

The sea became increasingly turbulent and noisy as if aroused [from sleep]

He was apprehensive when he saw the amazing uproar of the dragons. He
thought with apprehension in his heart that perhaps the day of the destruc-

jlluminated as if something divine had descended [from heaven]. In fact it
was caused by the glowing lustre of the arrow which flamed like one

After he had seen the monkeys, his eyes then fell upon Rāmawijaya (the
victorious Rāma), standing at the edge of the sea, obviously seething with
anger. God Baruṇa came forward respectfully, then sat crosslegged on the
water with his head bent down. He paid homage to Rāghawa with folded
hands and guickly spoke in friendly accent:

O, my lord, it is useless that you discharge an arrow into the water of the

your bewilderment which even causes you to forget your excellent origin>

“If your actions are only to display the danger of those things mentioned,

sWwithout doubt the monkeys would be able to construct a causeway when

On the arrival of the monkey-heroes, the forests were in uproar, the deer
ḍed away. Even the lions which were fearless in the past, took refuge in
ṭheir deep caves and kept themselves hidden, and especially so the deer.
Many of them forgot their love about their sucklings. They fled with injury
and penetrated into [the thickets] on the tops of mountains which consisted

of rock-crystals of jewels.

The elephants fled by fity together and plunged into the lake without
ñghting the monkeys, forgetting about their sharp tasks which they always
ṣharpen on the rocks. But they did not go in the same direction as the
miserable little animals. Yet they were not ashamed to flee away, despite

Without delay they arrived at the other side of the great occan and went
up to the mountain of Suwêla, north of the city of Lĕṅkā. It was an ex-
ceedingly beautiful mountain with marvellous and pleasing forests, like the
garden of Indra brought down to earth.

The fat stones were shining like brilliant rubies, the slopes seemed to be of
glittering silver, while the top was of sparkling gold. 1Its sands were [like]
jewels and pearls gleaming brightly and looked attractive. 1It was abound-
ing with precious stones, like the Suméru.

Deities, demi-gods with heavenly nymphs as singers, kinnaras and kinnarts,
stayed there all the time, entertaining themselves by playing flutes and all
kinds of lutes, and singing. Ohl It was as if the beauty of the mountain

resembled that of heaven.

The caves were extremely charming, resembling the halls of god Indra. It
was always light [inside] because there were many radiant sāryyakānta-stones,

They were playing the saṅghanis, or composing [poems], some were playing

ṣisted of three elements like those of Alakāwati without any difference.
Everything was there, even the cintāmagi (the jewel, which is capable of ful-
flling one’s wishes). It would not be inferior, even if the heaven of the god
of Love descended on earth.

The mandā;ra-trees were in full bloom, as if they had dressed themselves up.
A soft breeze was blowing but the trees stood steadily without swaying too
strongly, arousing only gentle movements, as if [the trees] were moving for-
ward to welcome [Raghūttama] whilst the sound of the buzzing of the
drunken bees was as its salutations.

The deodar pine trees were sweet-smelling, pure, tender and spreading
[their fragrance] everywhere. Some had fallen, with old age, and were
dead but still hard. It was as if they were placed in readiness on the
suṛyyakānta-stones. They would give continuous odorous vapour [ifit were
burnt] as a gift from the mountain of Suwéla.

Also the kapur-trees had an extraordinary aroma. From their bark, white
sap emitted and dropped onto the suṛṇwkānta stone. It evaporated and its
fumes smelled like incense to welcome [Raghūttama].

Wide and clear was the lake on the slope, with pure water. It looked
lovely as if inviting him to come to drink its water. The buds of the water-
Jilies were on the verge of blossoming, bulging out and expanding in size.
This was its welcoming gift when it paid its obeisance with respectful words.

And the citron trees were laden with green and glossy fruit, which would
provide a sparkling drink [the lake thought]. The sweet cries of the swans
sounded soft and tender, as if saying thus: ‘please stay here my lord¹.

There were many tall palm-trees on the banks of the lake, growing in rows

elephants who came to bathe in great numbers.

it was the fre of the god of Love flaring and aming, burning up the hearts
of those separated from their spouses.

Meanwhile king Daśānana was deeply in love [with Sītā]. He did not fnd

He could not eat and at night could not sleep. He moaned, his mind
wandered aimlessly and restlessly, without one bit of comfort. He thought
only of the princess incessantly. Ah! Passion was pernicious, as it tortured
like irresistible poison.

did his best to make himself good-looking.

He made illusory heads of king Rāma and the hero Lakṣmaṇa, which

Thus was his sly scheme to deceive, because he could not obtain a favour-

the approval of princess Janakasutām (about his proposal); and because of
this deep passion he had devised various plans.

On arrival at the pleasure garden, he went in without any doubts, that the
princess would accept him, because prince Rāma was already dead. He
spoke with persuasion, love, joy, and persistence:

*You have praised the power of Rāghawa as being beyond compare. In
reality he is without eual in cowardice, debased and had no strength to
counter-attack. In fact he was like rhubarb or leaves of string beans-plants
cut with a sickle or [in other wordsl Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa were like

Let us leave the princess, and let us relate about king Rāwaṇa, who had
committed the extremely gruesome deception, but which turned to be his
inferiority in steadfastness and aroused sadness in his heart.

He ordered his spies, the heroic and exceedingly mighty Śuka and Sāraṇa,
great heroes who were protectors in battles [gone by], to enter the lines of
the enemies on the mountain of Suwéla.

3. Milaṅa ṅ bala wānara prawīra,

They should count the prominent ones of the monkey host, they should
investigate their power and whether they were devoted or not to Rāma,
also concerning the king of the monkeys, whether he was prepared to die in
a battle or likely to be willing to surrender.

4, Ya ikā ta pakon iraṅ Daśāsya, dadi luṅhā Śuka Sāraṇātiśrghra,

These were the assignments of Daśāsya given to them. Śuka and Sāraṇa
went speedily, and arrived at the mountain of Suwéla. Then they took a
disguise as monkeys.

a. D Wibhisanākhyām.
They were detected by Wibhīṣaṇa, who stepped in front of them courageously
and spoke: *Suka and Sāraṇa, what are you doing here and what is your
purpose. What does it mean that you disguise yourself as monkeys»

d. A winwati.

Thus were his words of inuiry. Śuka and Sāraṇa remained silent out of

embarrassment. They were looked on by the crowd and attacked, finally
captured and tied up. Then uickly they were brought [in front of Rāma].

this should be attempted.

and no trace of concern. With dismay Daśānana watched at him (acting
like that).

Daśamukha was sitting in the audience hall with numerous attendants. He
did not bother about the bad omen and sat there carefree. Aṅgada moved
forward and sat in front of him and directly spoke to him slowly with a
forceful voice that was heard loud and clear.

Thus were the words of Aṅgada, as friendly as possible, attempting to give
counsel. Daśānana turned red, his whole body trembled with fury. His
eyebrows knit, his forehead furrowcd with anger. With eyes protruding,
he pointed at Aṅgada:

:Ah. How shameless and sinful is this ape. All right, he is courageous and
mighty (ba), because he is the son of Bāli, but he is talking utter rubbish
and has no shame before people who know that he is debased. He talks
about the power of dignity, while he himself is the destroyer of the greatest
dignity (dharmma).

These were the words of Rāwaṇa, abusing the fear inspiring messenger.
The son of Bāli, his anger aroused, replied: *Talk, while you still can, O,
stupid man, as if you will not be slain. Wait till your body is torn to pieces
by Raghusuta together with all your troops.

Thus said Aṅgada and returned fearlessly. Daśagriwa was very apprehen-
sive and discussed the matter with his attendants. His behaviour and
actions were not as in the past, but very anxious. Only because of his
great arrogance he did not look afraid. He stood up resolutely.

Let us leave king Rāwaṇa and let us relate about Aṅgada. Quickly he
arrived at the cave [on the Suwêla mountain] and went inside, paying his
obeisance to Rāmawijaya respectfully. Then he spoke, explaining all that
Daśamukha told him.

Lakṣmaṇa who saw [Aṅgada come], followed by Nīla, Nāla, Sugrīwa,
Anilasuta, Suséṇa, and Winata, went in. They were followed by all the
monkeys, who sat orderly but noisily. They were given fruit to eat which
were found at the peak of the mountain (śikkariw).

Thus spoke the demon. The heart of his wife broke into pieces as if struck
with a fst. She did not utter a word and did not take her child from him;
because of sadness her tears ran down, and shattered was her love. Her
limbs gave away and she embraced her husbands leg, while she sobbed
jerkily. The demon hero was very affected, lovingly he embraced her and
placed her [and the child] on the couch.

*My love, stop that sobbing, as that is not the way people can obtain

Afer the demon-hero told his wife about the teachings of dkarmma [Law],

were wild, angry, revengeful, and laughed dangerously with open mouth.
They were resolved in their minds to kill Rāmawijaya. ¢We will win, they
said, because they were always presumptuous and foolish.

They did not know that they would be annihilated together with their
families and relatives. Their apprehension disappeared at the look of crows
and wild dogs. They came in great numbers, as never happened before
and emitted loud cries as if they were happy. Indeed they were happy, as
the wicked people, the demon race would be wiped out.

you only will be victorious in battle. It is seen in the portents that is why
I am so convinced.

When they arrived at the periphery of the city of Lĕṅkām, they roared simul-

pointed teeth they resembled the kiṅkarus of the god of Death (Yama) who
was coming to take the lives of the demons away.

They moved forward to the south, then prepared and divided themselves in
accordance with the frontlines. Some divisions occupied the west and
ṣouthern regions which were crowded and packed with monkey units.
Others took positions to the east of the city, also densely packed looking as
if there was an amazing flood of monkeys, thunderous, uproarious and

Who could count the sand on the beach? That was the euivalent number
of the monkey-host. To the north and to the south the city was full,
literally covered with monkeys without any space left: The whole region
of the city of Lĕṅkā was completely surrounded, covered, threshed and
trampled on [by the monkeys].

Not hal of them had arrived, many of them had not yet come. The line

The more they came, the more the hustle and bustle. They bumped into

earth were about to split open and the mountains to collapse. Even the
sky appeared about to fall, flled with the cries of the monkeys.

They behaved in various ways, unpredictable, eager to fght, beckoning (the

ṅous salutations, others were giving glances amorously, as if they regarded
the enemy as harmless beautiful girls.

The king of the monkeys was instructed in the tradition, was given to know
which was north and which was south. There was no possibility that he
should follow the teachings, as basically the nature [of an ape] was thought-
less and dumb, but not recalcitrant. On the other hand the power of
Raghūttama was capable of imparting knowledge to everyone in the world.

However, he did not show his fear, which was natural for a king. He
concealed all the anxieties in his heart, so that nobody could see.

The main force on a level feld were the wagons, infantry and horsemen,
armed with clubs, bows and arrows, and they were ordered to stay under

were the main force.

Those who were to fight on an open feld were arranged in battle arrays,
the infantry in the middle anked by horsemen. Behind the infantry came
the mobile units in wagons for support. This was called the makarānana
(the makara-battle array) which was known from ancient times as the most
prominent battle array.

The horsemen were organized in lines in the middle, the infantry flanked

of wild lions, their red hair curly and twisted, looking like the flame of fire,
ṭheir big round, bulging, red eyes always glowing like burning coal, they
were indeed awe-inspiring, even feared by Kala, the god of Death incarnate.

They looked savage as the pupils of their eyes moved like lightning flashes.
Their thick and unkept beards were black like clouds in the rainy season,
ṭheir breathing was hissing like a dangerous thunderstorm. They shouted
and roared vociferously like lions which sounded like the rumbling of
thunder.

Roaring and shouting they advanced further, drunk with eagerness to
attack. Then the clash came, they struck with swords, stabbing and cutting,
throwing discs, beating with clubs and maces, stabbing with lāṅgalas, snar-

Forcefully the heroes on the wagons rotated their clubs in their left hand,
and with their lassoes in their right hand they whipped the horses, which
ran and jumped trampling to death everyone and everything on their way.
The soldiers on the wagons discharged their short javelins which hit the

The horsemen were prepared to attack and when they attacked, they did
not fail. They kept attacking regardless of whether they knew the enemy
was killed or not. One who was spying on them was too late to report.
They saw the vanguard of the monkey host, and swiftly like an eagle they
swooped down in a flash with their snares and soon they dragged the
monkeys [caught in the snares].

Then other heroes in armour attire were so savage and uncontrolled they
gave in to thcir anger and with lips drawn back they attacked with their

and many of them were injured or killed.

The monkeys who saw their mates trapped were furious and made a coun-

the demons], they punched, they bit and beat with their tails They took
hold of the waist of the demons pressed them in their arms and smashed
them swiftly on the ground while they pulled off the demonīs arms.

Other monkeys used their sharp nails in a shocking way. The stomach of a
demon was pierced to the back while he picked the demon up by his bot-
tom. When he saw another demon he threw the demon on to him and he
fell backward and died. Blood spattered from his mouth which was smashed
to pieces, hit by stones thrown at him.

And powerful monkeys were attacking the approaching horses. They
grabbed the horses by the manes and smashed them against ñat stones, hard

jetted from their noses.

An amazingly courageous monkey grabbed the legs of a demon with ease,
because of his power. He dragged the demon through sharp stones, so that
his chest was torn to pieces. Other monkeys were as playful as children.
They competed with each other to climb on the backs of demons and pulled
on [their hair] so that they cried out loudly in dismay.

Other flying monkeys swooped down and grabbed the arms of the enemy.
Then heartlessly they carricd the struggling demons on their hips. The
demons met their death after slow torture, as the flying monkeys had bitten
them until their bodies no longer looked like bodies.

The king of the monkeys was like a lion when he punched and struck with
his hands. His hands were full of clots of blood, because he hit demons on

but the monkey-king used his bare hand to strike and pulled off their noses
and their teeth fell out when they were also hit.

Also the demons Kghting in the forests were very dangerous. Their bows
were as big as a palm tree of an armspan in circumference and their arrows
had the circumference of a coconut, its point was one armspan long, sharp
and pointed. They shot with this kind of arrow, which looked exactly like
the canine-teeth of the god of Death. g

moaned, trembled in contraction, plunged into severe pain.

The monkey-host was in increasing trouble as more and more monkeys were
badly injured. They were bruised, wounded by swords, their sinews and

slowly, and in a miserable state, yet thcy were hunted when they withdrew
and a shower of arrows rained on them.

When the monkey host was thrown back in shocking defeat and miserable

tigers on the track of game, chasing relentlessly eager to capture.

They held horrible clubs of an armspan in circumference in their hands.
They struck together with their clubs to kill [the elephants] Some were
using flat stones as missiles and the flying monkeys threw rocks upon [the
elephants].

The most mighty monkeys climbed and rode on the backs of the elephants.
They kicked with their soles forcefully against the ribs. There were others
who one against one were kicking at the head and neck of the elephants.

Other monkeys came rotating their clubs and struck on the trunks of the

the eyes out, without giving to the elephants a chance to counter their
actions.

Subseuently the ribs of the elephants were broken, the intestines were

Other elephants were thrown on their back with their legs spread. Their
jaws and necks were pressed with the knee [of the monkeys] their chests
were stabbed with the nails, and kicked and punched, their four legs were
twisted and broken off,

Further, there were elephants whose rumps were torn open and they were
pushed forward, so that they fell on their knees in no time. The neck was
bent and the body folded. The white tusks broke off like bukuṅ-flowers.

decrease in number. They came in greater numbers and fought also in
deep rivers, as the great clephants knew how to fght in deep water.

So, the two armies clashed against each other, while holding their defence-

could be said that the number was tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,

that collected was so amazing, that the depth of it reached to the chest [of a
man]. Elephants' wagons and foot-soldiers were destroyed and the playful
horses were crushed miserably.

The battlefeld looked red and very terrifying The lake of Yama [the god
of Death] would look as beautiful as that if it descended to earth. Tīhe
water [of the lake of Yama] was dirty blood, reeking and spreading every-

His body was big and tall, tough and strong, difñcult to bend or to turn
him upside down. He was not less in fury and savageness than a tiger, and
was an oföpring of a tough hero-family.

experienced in fighting mighty opponents, swift in movements and steadfast
in mind.

Sampāti appearing to be a worthy opponent [for Prajaṅgha] stepped for-
ward, brandishing an immense club. With his back to the opponent he
stepped backward in a move of single combat, while his tail was moving
gracefully and playfully.

Prajāṅgha was also very careful, when the club [of Sampmtil came, he
jumped away. They turned around chasing each other looking for an
opening, as it seemed that neither of them could be trapped.

After a long time of ighting Prajaṅgha was on the losing side. When his
leg came and was at the point of hitting [Sampāmti] he was struck by the
club so hard that his head was flung away atter it took a combination of
blows [from Sampāti]- Blood jetted out and he passed away.

of bravery in battle and was known to be uneualled in ferocity. He had
at his side an extremely sharp sword with which he attacked the monkeys.
That was why Bāyuputra went forward, seized him and dashed him to his
death on a big rock.

Wirūpāmkṣa was restless at his guard post in the palace. He was excited
when he heard the sound ofthe battle, and sped away to appear on the
battleñeld.

Lakṣmaṇa stepped forward with conñdence. He shot at Wirūpākṣa who
fell instantly. S]wiftly Aśaniprabha organised a counter attack, but he was
struck by the club of Drawiḍa.

When the heroes were killed, Indrajit went forward on his wagon while
rotating his club which had a circumference of one armspan. Fearlessly
Aṅgada advanced rotating a huge tree. He struck at the horses which were
killed and the wagon reduced to pieces.

Raghūttama, the king of the apes, and Lakṣmaṇa saw the actions of Aṅgada
and praised highly the achievement of the excellent son of Bāli. Wibhīṣaṇa
laughed heartily beholding it, the monkeys clapped their hands while
cheering aloud.

Meanwhile the deities in the sky were clamorous shouting aloud the fact
that Indrajit was hit. The sky was full of excitement, the demons were in
fear. Indrajit's face turned pale and he returned home in shame.

Because in the past he was never defeated in battle. He was always victo-
rious and all his opponents were beaten. Even god Indra, though a deity,
was captured by him. Thus was the fame of Indrajit, spreading all over
the world.

Ya ikana ta hilaṅ mĕné r-hiḍĕp, yaśa nira śīrṇna ri śīrṇna niṅ ratha,

He thought that his fame was finished now. All his merit was gone at the
moment when his wagon was smashed. The death of his horses was like
his own defeat. That was the reason for his sense of shame.

discs (without faill. Other demons were caught in their flight and they
were mowed down to death.

Thus they were totally destroyed and it was impossible for them to regroup.
They took their refuge in the fortresses. Then time passed. The sun set,
as if he were hiding, reluctant to see the eeing demons.

At this time Méghanāda was seething with fury, aroused by the death of

prepared to pray for his snake-arrow.

After his concentration of thought had worked to perfection, he smiled and
was convinced that he would not be beaten [again]. He took his oversized

On arrival at the battleeld he roared vigorowsly as loud as booming
thunder with its deep sound. The earth and the sky vibrated with it, and
that was why he was called Méghanāda (the thunder).

The monkeys were in trouble, shocked and dumb-founded. They did not

Besides the body of Méghanāda was very small, though his roaring was loud
like that of a lion. The monkeys became more and more frightful when
they heard the vociferousness of the roar. They did not know what to do,
as they could not see the enemy.

Dhūmrmkṣa was sad to see the demons bursting asunder. He moved forward
in his wagon Siṅhāsya emitting loud creaking sounds. The notorious horses,
Wrĕkāsya were neighing excitedly, immediately pouncing on the monkeys
which jumped aside [to evade their hooves].

Dhūmrākṣa, standing in his wagon was rotating his club, covering the
monkeys which withdrew to every direction, akraid of being smashed. Then
Maāruti, quite agitated ew forward, like an excited peacock which had
found a snake.

*BCDE. d. B winawir. K sapatraliuā.

pPawanasuta moved forward with a thrill of delight- He grabbed a rock as
big as a hill, hard and sharp. He juggled it up in his right hand, while his
left hand was extended widely in a dance position. In this way he showed
his broad shoulders like a gracefully widespread wing [of a bird].

Furiously Dhūmrākṣa rushed forward in a fash, jumped out of his wagon
clubbed him in resentment and jumped back into his wagon. Anilaputra
was not surprised when he was clubbed like that, he did not move, was not
hurt, not perturbed. [Indeed he was] unegualled [in valour].

Dhūmrākṣa struck again, but his club bounced back, while the person he
hit was uninjured and not moving [an inch]. Playfully he pushed his chest
more forward, taunting to be hit, eager in gathering fame in battle.

Śaṅkā yan lagi ginadā madan ta mundur,

When he thought he was on the verge of being hit again, nimbly he stepped
back. On his forward thrust he swiftly threw the stone [in his right
hand]. Dhūmrākṣa, seeing the stone thrown on him, showed his evil nature.
He moved to evade [the rock] as he was afraid of being hit and injured.

When he moved away, his wagon was hit and smashed to dust. Wrĕkāsya,
the horses did not look like horses anymore, pitifully turned into minccd
meat by Māruti. (They were killed and their bodies smashed).

Dhūmrākṣa who had lost his wagon, rushed forward in fury. He used a
club as weapon in the fight. He tried to kill Marutsuta by pounding him
with his club in guick tempo, his face grim and unyielding, his heart
burning [with anger].

Bāywātmaja did not move [an inch] under the blows. He was not afraid of
the blows [he received], he went forward fearlessly. ‘You cannot let this
powerless creature stay alive, he thought and caught the legs of
Dhūmrāmkṣa.

After the legs were seized, Pawanasuta pulled them and swung the demon
onto a rock with his face down, so that his jaws were fractured, his tonsils
were pushed in and his heart shattered. Clotted blood flowed out his
mouth.

In a second Dhūmrākṣa's life led away. Ahl Ah! shouted the demons,
running away in horror. The deities cheered noisily, praising Pawanasuta
while uttering the word ‘Good! Goodl The dcities in the sky excitedly
looked on.

The debased and deceitful Dhūmrākṣa was turned to dust and his attendants
were also annihilated by the monkey heroes who were very furious, and
enraged they rushed them violently. Even the earth was shaken and
destroyed by them, let alone the powerless demons. They were devastated
and hunted. In disarray the survivors fled home to give report.

Rāwaṇa was pitiful and hopeless when he received the report about the
death of Dhūmrākṣa in battle. He ordered Akampana to organise a counter-
attack. He was forbidden to come back, if he did not defeat the enemy.
ḍI will defeat the enemy or I will be killed, O lord, thus was the promise of
the hero Akampana, without regard to his own life.

Afier perceiving the order of his master completely, he took leave respect-
fully and set out to battle. His great and spacious wagon was ready, with
hundreds of sharp bows of ve armspan long and of an armspan in circum-
ference. The string was of the size of a coconut in circumference.

When he set out his left shoulder throbbed and a heavy wind was blowing.
White ants were in uproar, groups of jackals were meeting him howling
and barking tumultously. Thus were the numerous bad portents seen by
the hero Akampana. But he was not afraid, because his mind was full of
fury, bewilderment, perplexity and evil intentions.

When Akampana arrived [at the battlefeld], he was stormed by hordes of
monkeys. He drew his bow and discharged sharp arrows on the monkeys.
His arrows were so plentiful that the sky seemed to be completely covered
with them, the monkeys were mowed down by arrows, badly injured and no
one could escape.

Hanūmān was angered by this. He broke off a big palm tree, solid inside
and used that as a stick. Easily and nicely he rotated it and it spun per-
fectly. Carefully Akampana attempted to hit Hanūmān with an arrow,
but they were beaten away by the rotating stick, or bounced back, broken
to pieces and blunted.

The excellent Māruti moved further forward without being hit, as he was so
skilful in [rotating his stick]. A shower of arrows fell on him but he was
not injured, not even hit. He approached Akampana and stabbed him
[with the stick] which made him fall, followed by just one blow. He died
when his chest was split, his arms broken off, and blood flowed freely from
his chost.

His attendants fearfully dispersed, chased away like game by a tiger. All
were attempting to save their skin, competing in speed in their ñight [to
safety] to report the news. Daśāsya sighed sadly, humbly and hopelessly
worrying about the great calamity. In the past he was boastful and full of
ṣelf-esteem, now he was timid and uiet.

He was restless in his seat, his mind was in horror, wandering and could
not concentrate. He left his throne and went around the city. He ordered
a demon to summon the prime minister Prahasta to come into the palace,
to receive the order to mobilizc his units to come out to battle. The prime
minister himself should become the protector of the heroes in battle.

Thus spoke Rāwaṇa vehemently. The demon ordered ran away and

guickly spoke: ‘Get the guard ready and lead them into combat. This is

After all arrangements for the guards have been made, so that all doubtful
feelings [are eliminated], your slave asked your consent to leave to set out

Thus spoke Prahasta respectfully. Then he went to make preparations for
the distribution of excellent alms. All kinds of religious gifts were distri-
buted to brahmins and perfect religious teachers, e.g. gold, pearls, crystals
of diamond and other excellent gifs, red silken materials, clothes, buffaloes,
horses, elephants, female slaves, and fragrant garlands.

ARer the distribution of wealth was over, he was given the blessings by
the brahmins and prayers were performed for his wellbeing and victory in
battle. Also offerings in the temples and solemn ceremonies according to
customs were carried out all the time. Holy impetuous weapons were
invoked and were placed together with other weapons.

Further on the departure of the horsemen and wagons together with those
on elephants as vanguard, deep sounding kettle drums, drum and cymbals
were beaten, filling up the ten directions with .confused noises. Prahasta
was in a happy mood. He prayed to god Waiśwānara and his offerings
consisted of the flame of oil and grain. Then he took leave to come out [to
battle].

Out of eagerness he uickly mounted on his great and spacious wagon
which was as big as a hill. He had dressed himself up, complete with gold-

crown on his head were brightly shining. He resembled the sun staying on

His heart became more and more excited, when he was taken in procession

The portents that forebode his death in the battleñeld were as follows.
Prahasta saw groups of jackals running towards him, barking and howling
around him. The earth shook, there was a horrible rain of blood, and
banners broke with a loud crack. Those were the fatal dangers which fore-
told certain death, already known as bad portents since ancient times.

Prahasta was not perturbed, when he saw them. He was steadfast. He
had no attachment to life, he did not consider what was better to do for
himself. If it was other than to fall in battle, then certainly it would invite
disgrace and hell, but if he died in combat, it was like an ofering which
had as result heavenly Bliss.

Thus thought Prahasta, his mood was resolute and unwavering. On arrival,
he challenged the monkeys to meet him in battle and ordered his warriors
to advance in a battle array called Arddhacandra (crescent moon) with the
main force in the centre and thrusting flanks. The battle array of the
monkey units came into confusion, as they were repeatedly caught in hand
to hand fghting, which entangled them [with the demons] and could not be
separated.

So the supreme commander of the army moved forward giving directions
and instructions to the warriors. The chiefs of the demons came running,
encouraging his soldiers. Soon they were engaged in hand to hand Kghting,
beating and chasing each other. They were attacking, and pushing each
other, trying to deceive and to fatten each other.

The demons were fighting with swords, discs, daggers, knives, lances and
matchets. The monkeys were fghting with their bare hands, stones, clubs,
teeth, stabbing with their nails and strangling [the demons]. Victims fell
on both sides, but again and again they came back, and many were injured
on both sides. But they were not afraid and with renewed hatred and anger
they fell upon each other.

Hundreds and hundreds of tigers and lions fighting against wild dragons

The demons looked exactly like the god of Death, with their spotted bodies
and bulging eyes. They swung to the fanks and started to attack. No one
suffered cramp, as in the past they always succeeded in cutting off heads of
ṭhe enemies, but the monkeys were alert, and were skilled in looking side-
ways. When they were on the verge of being hit by swords or other big
weapons, they parried the blows and the demons were killed instantly struck
by their fists.

Another demon with a knife came to attack. But his knife was seized. Then
it was pulled suddenly, so that the demon fell over on his knees and lost his
knife, which moved into the hand of the monkey who at length killed the
demon with his own knife. His stomach was pierced by the knife, blood
and intestines which were cut to pieces, came out.

The demons were much inferior in power. Everyone coming forth was
killed. Prahasta was furious, he moved his wagon forth which went with a
creaking sound. He drew his bow, put excellent arrows on and mowed the
monkeys down with salvoes of arrows.

Thousands and thousands of monkeys were chased and hit by the arrows at
various places. There were monkeys who were hit on their jaws, or lost
their nose or got their chests split, or their buttocks pierced. Others were
hit on their shoulders and ribs, and blood spattered around from their
wounds. There were monkeys whose cheeks were almost sliced off and still
they wanted to bite.

When other salvoes of arrows came, more and more monkeys were destroyed
or wounded. The arrows were so numerous and they (the arrowṣ) issued
other arrows, so that the ten directions seemed to be covered all over by
them. Besides one arrow issued one hundred arrows each and they were
raining down on to the monkeys who were torn to pieces. As the arrows
seemed to stick on the bodies of the monkeys, covering them all over,

the dead bodies of the monkeys did not look like corpses. It was saddening
to look at them hit by arrows. They were like porcupines, as the arrows
werc struck on the body covering it all over. Sugrīwa was griefstricken
when he saw the monkey-host was thrown back in the counter-attack
[of the demons]. He beckoned Nīla with his hand that moved guickly, and
spoke in a friendly accent:

‘Hey N1la, do not stand idle. The monkey army was destroyed, come
forward uickly, and engage Prahasta in combat. He is the prime minister
[of Leṅkā]. Kill this prime minister, as he is killing the whole word. He
thinks that there should be no world at all That is what he carelessly

Thus were the words of the king of the monkeys, giving the order uickly to

Nīla who did not hesitate at all [to carry it out]. He advanced guickly

with a big raṅdi-tree, ten fathoms long and used it as a club.

The wise Nīla was shot at with arrows, but none of them could hit or injure

The battlefield was uproarious and spacious like the sea, the sizzling arrows
of Prahasta were like the water. Nila was like the horrible ñre of the
waḍawa-hell. His club was like the fame [of the waḍawā-ñre]l which
consumed the arrows.

The arrows of Prahasta were like fire at Doomsday, extremely hot and any
monkey hit by it was burnt, Nīla was like the clouds at Doomsday, and his
club was like rain extinguishing the fire.

Though Prahasta had discharged one thousand arrows on him, the heroic
monkey Nīla was not injured- Though shot at from a short distance, which
should hit anyone else, Nīla was not hit, as he was so skilfl [in parrying
off the arrows].

The arrows could not go through. They were struck aside or rebounded,

of all kinds of formulas, the only person affected by the spells was the
person employing them.

Prahasta was soon very weary. He tried not to slow-down in discharging
his arrows. But because he was tired, his arrows were not so hot anymore.

He swayed his bludgeon and Nīla swung his club. They both moved very
guickly and were extremely full of spirit. They beat each other angrily,
but nobody was injured, as their body was so strong like steel.

Besides Prahasta had an armour on, which was hard and flexible when
pounded on. The body of N1la too was as tough as iron, though hit by the
bludgeon again and again, it did not show any effect.

Even that was the case, both of them were not injured. Fearlessly they
pounded at each other, both courageous and grim looking. Swittly they
stepped back and were separated from each other, but turning around they
swung their clubs and bludgeons.

The tactics applied by the prime minister Prahasta were based on the

Nila was also in good shape for a duel. He jumped easily and was ñrm in
his stance or steps. His tail was supple moving lively like a rank of a

Afer they fought with knives, they fought again with clubs. Nila and
Prahasta turned around and around, kicking, pounding, whipping and
snarling at each other. They stabbed at each other and fell on their backs,
but soon engaged in a gruesome fight.

covered by dust.

Their pursuit of each other in circles appeared to have the form of a
spinning wheel, up and down in full force. [The onlookers] saw them in
pursuit of each other heavily breathing, trying to kill each other, competing
in courageous exploits.

The wise Nīla had been looking for a strategy for long. He chased Prahasta
down, and when Prahasta was above, Nīla went down. They turned and
swayed along speedily.

When Nīla was on his way down, he found a trick. He snatched a big

happened so fast. Then he turned to chase Prahasta.

Prahasta, seeing that he was chased, went downward. At that time he was
outwitted and hit by the stone. Without a second blow his neck was
broken, his head pushed in and smashed to dust, his brains scattered, his
eyes pulled out and flung far away.

When Prahasta was slain, the wicked [demons] dispersed [everywhere] in
fear. They were shocked and terror stricken when they saw it happened,
then turned around and fled away. The formidable Nila chased and
trampled them down, pushed them back. He was like a lion in pursuit
of a deer, extremely irresistible.

The demons were vanuished without resistance. They withdrew completely
without attempting to counter-act, as they were exhausted. Groaning and
out of breath they entered the palace. Weeping they made a report of
what happened.

When Daśamukha was told about the death of the prime minister, he
became more fearful, his heart trembled constantly. Spiritless he went to
the main gate and stood with colourless face. Then he spoke:

*Hey. all of you, demonsl Wake up my brother. What is Kumbhakarṇṇa
so indifferent [wasting his time] sleeping. He only does what he wishes.
He has no brains like a water-buffalo. [His heart] is overwhelmed by tamah
(ignorance), so that he becomes inert and apathetic.

Thus were the words of Daśamukha. All the demons stood up [and went],
beating drums, blowing trumpets, and horns. Others were beating cymbals,
tuwuṅs, r¥gaṅs, and all music-instruments emitting soft and loud sounds. All
of these instruments were played and beaten in full spirit, so loud and
noisy.

The sound of all the instruments was booming like thunder. The sound of
clapping of the hands and cymbals was like thunderclaps. Nevertheless
the sleeper seemed not to hear them. On the other hand, the arms of the
people beating the instruments became sore.

The people attempting to wake [Kumbhakarṇṇa] were uproarious, but he
remained snoring. They came out with their plans and tricks. There were
some who bit him, pinched him with their hard nails, but the nails broke.
Some were stabbing him with knives, but the knives bent and were almost
broken.

There were some ofñcers on horseback. They let their horses trample on
his body very hard in their effort to awake him. Then fve hundred
elephants stamped on him, but [Kumbhakarṇṇa] felt as if he were being
massaged, and was only too happy.

Then there were wagons as big as mountains which were driven over his
body, but the wheels were just like a pleasant treatment to him, and the
booming of the music-instruments was just like chamber music. His snoring
became stronger, rumbling thunderously.

All tricks and skill were applied, but it was not them that made
[Kumbhakarṇṇa] woke up. It was a coincidence. It was the time of his
rising up, that made him wake up. He wiped his eyes, arose and spoke:

. Aparan iké prayojana mataṅ nya akug winuṅu,

‘What is the purpose that you wake me upè7 Then the demons answered
happily and respectfully: ‘It is by the order of the king that we wake you
up, because the enemy has come and the prime minister has been slain.

Thus were the words of the soldiers, inviting him to enter [the palace of the
king]- So he washed, made himself up, changed his clothes, wore flowers
and body cream. Then his breakfast was served, consisting of rice in millionṇs
of rice-steamers.

The side-dishes consisted of cooked meat of lions and elephants piled up in

After his breakfast was over, he went into the palace to receive audience.
When he entered [the audience hall], he found his brother in deep thought.
His face was pale, his breathing heavy, his heart-beat was fast from fear.
The trace of great fear was apparent in his slow speech:

When Kumbhakarṇṇa walked, the earth shook, everybody and everything
were in uproar. The earth uaked, trembled, and swayed heavily, as if it
were breaking asunder. The Himawān-mountain jolted, the Suméru-
mountain trembled, the ocean rumbled thunderously. The world was in
horror, the dragons were on guard for what would come.

When he had worn a gold-plated armour which shone brightly, he radiated
like a burning mountain, looking exceedingly dangerous. The people
looking at him were dazzled and closed their eyes in terror. The sun was

In appearance he was as horrible as īéwara in his Mahābhairawa-form. In

the sun at doomsday, burning hot. His face was like that of Mrĕtyu (the
god of Death), with his terrible canine-teeth so sharp and pointed.

The portents which foretold his death were red clouds appearing in the sky.
Intermittently a shower of blood poured down together with flesh and
intestines. The crows were clamorous, swooping down from above, many
fire-balls fell. His left eye and shoulder throbbed and twitched.

But he was not dismayed or dejected when he saw the bad portents. He
even became more determined to assault the attacking monkey-host. They
took hold of him, together they clambered on him, so that his body was
covered all over with monkeys, resembling a mountain completely wrapped
in clouds.

Thus Kumbhakarṇṇa was mobbed by countless clamouring monkeys with
rocks, missiles, clubs, hard stones as discs. Others were pounding with their

every direction or pulling at him, looking for ways to hurt him by biting or
scratching his eyes with their sharp nails.

Despite all this he was not injured, all the rocks -and mountains turned to
dust, the clubs smashed to pieces on impact. Then Kumbhakarṇṇa turned
ṭo counter the attack of the monkeys by devouring them, both hands in turn
dashed monkeys onto his thighs and knees, or tore apart limb by limb, so
ṭhat their intestines were broken into pieces. Other monkeys were knocked
on the head and their spouting blood was drunk [by Kumbhakarṇṇa].

Numerous other monkeys were trampled down and could not move a muscle
under his weight or they were hit by his enormous club or screwered by his
Jance, their tongues hung out and when they were slapped on their face, the
tongue fell off- He trod on others, while his hand pulled on tails of other
monkeys who were plunged into difñculties because when they tried to free
ṭhemselves, they were skinned to death.

The longer the battle, the more agitated Kumbhakarṇṇa became, and in-

from bad to worse the more monkeys he eat, his stomach was never full,
even after being flled with millions and millions of monkeys, as his hunger
resembled the fre of the Terrible Kāla. The fre in his stomach consumed
everything coming in and turned them to ashes.

He was like god Kāla (god of Time) consuming all creatures at the end

blood and brains, intestines were winding around his neck and body like a
brahmanic castecord. Thus was Mahākāla dressed at the time of the dest-
ruction of the world to assemble them. Thus was the appearance of
Kumbhakarṇṇa when, stained with blood, he was devouring the monkeys.

He looked like a horrible big mountain, as his mouth looked so awhul,
filled up with the red blood of the monkeys. 1It resembled a cave of a moun-
tain, out of which red dkatu was owing. The monkeys had not thc courage to
look at it, their hearts were terror stricken, in panic they fled away, thinking
the world was all dark around them, and entered undergrowths and bushes,

Some wcre taking refuge on mountain tops, in caves and holes to hide thejr
skin, others were climbing on trees e.g. capok, kukap, manggo, kśpuṅ, hambulu,

etc. The trees shook because of their weight, as if they were reluctant to
accommodate the monkeys who had fled from the battlefeld.

The monkeys could not maintain their seats as the trees were shaking.
They jumped to other branches, but found no refuge as the whole tree was
shaking in fear. Other monkeys were climbing on palm trees and wanted
to wrap themselves in leaheaths of the palm trees, but they were pricked
by the fibers and descended crying out with pain.

The monkeys on the ground were in uproar [when thcy fell on them]. So

around with bent backs, screaming in pain when they were trodden on by
their companions because the slopes were packed with them. Some of them
went to the beach and ran to the causeway.

Moreover when the enemy is slain completely in battle, your offering is
certain. It is a pity that you do not look for an offering, while that should
be always kept in mind. Clearly the silent repetition of prayers to god
Mahāwīra Bhadréśwara in battle is the link with the oferings place [that
js the battleeld], your offerings wood is the body of the enemies, the perfect
offerings dish is blood and brains.

What is still needed in the offerings in the battleñeld, because cverything is
ready for the yoga (union with God). Your howls, shouts and lions roar
are your prayers in battle which give rise to happiness and heaven, and
your family will hnd a good life because of the power of your courage,
steadfastness and eminence. You should strive for fame which can be
obtained by heroic deeds, and in the world you will be praised.

Nā ta wuwus saṅ Aṅgada makon umuwah apuliha,

Thus said Aṅgada urging them to return. T[he spirit of the monkeys was
aroused as if they were agitated. Their fear disappeared, they wanted to
full in battle and fghting fercely they made an attack. Thundering and in
closed units they resembled the sea at hightide.

Maṅhrĕṅ maṅhrik ya makrak prakaṭa kadi gĕlap ghora śabda nya mahyā,

mawyaṅ mĕkĕl wulu nyojwala paḍa kumĕlab rāmbutiṅ wānarākwèh.
Loudly they roared and cried and shouted, sounding like thunder. High-
spirited they attacked simultaneously after they had learnt the excellent
instruction [of Aṅgada]. ‘IfI am killed, let it be  thus all of them said,
The curly and reddish hair of the monkeys shone brilliantly.

Sakwèh niṅ wīra maṅhèr paḍa ta ya maṅadĕg bāp ikaṅ wré sĕnaddha,

All the waiting warriors stood up. The monkeys were countless and ready
in units of hundred, hundred thousand or millions looking like the sea.
North, South, West and East were full of waiting monkeys. 1In brief, they
were all holding clubs made of manggo-trees which they pulled out anḍ
used as weapons.

Sāmpun tékāṅrĕgĕp wrĕkṣa kadi ta ya gunuṅ sañjata nyātirodra,

After they held trees in their hands, they lookcd like a mountain of weapors,
very dangerous. All the warriors moved forward, the longer the Kuster, as
their friends were running too, the trees were trembling, blown by the heavy
wind which originated from Kumbhakarṇṇajs nose, which blew amazingly
strong. r
